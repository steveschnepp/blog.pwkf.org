<p>In Java, the commonly accepted way is to use the <code>final</code> keyword.
But it has a major drawback : the object cannot be <em>redefined</em>, but can
be <em>modified</em> by calling mutable members. You have to convert it to an
immutable type. This is a simple task, but radically different ways exists.</p>
<h2>Achieve Immutable in Java</h2>
<p>We'll see some differents methods with a common example. Let's start with a
very simple <code>Point</code> class :</p>
<pre>
public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    void setX(int i) { this.x = i; }
    void setY(int i) { this.y = i; }
    int getX() { return this.x; }
    int getY() { return this.y; }
}
</pre>
<h3>The <em>Java Collection way</em></h3>
<p>It is the easiest way. It is designed to be a drop-in, like in the Java
Collection API. You just create a read-only class that derives your read-write
class just like the <code>PointReadOnly</code> that mimics the r/o List. It
overrides all the methods either to delegate or to forbid calling by throwing a
run-time exception.</p>
<pre>
public class PointReadOnly extends Point {
    private final Point inner;
    public PointReadOnly(Point p) { this.inner = p };

    void setX(int i) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;PointReadOnly is read-only&quot;);
    }
    void setY(int i) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;PointReadOnly is read-only&quot;);
    }

    int getX() { return inner.getX(); }
    int getY() { return inner.getY(); }
}
</pre>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>You can use it <strong>right-now</strong> : Your code can slowly evolve to
progressively generate and integrate this new object without really knowing
it's here. The misuses, that are changing the object, will be catched in the
testing phase when exceptions are being thrown. The use of a good logging
system in the setters is a nice addition.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<p>Any pedantic compiler should warn you that the setter parameter isn't read.
I tried to be quite clever and find ways to ignore it. Just rewrite it as :</p>
<pre>
    void setX(int i) {
        if (i == 0) { /* Do nothing but keep the compiler happy */ }
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;PointReadOnly is read-only&quot;);
    }
</pre>
<p>The performance penalty is minimal since any compiler should optimize the
if-case away and even if not, <strong>this function should not be called
anyway</strong>.</p>
<p>But <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/786740/how-to-avoid-the-unused-param-warning-when-overriding-a-method-in-java-1-4/786794#786794" hreflang="en">as a user on StackOverflow pointed</a>, that warning
<em>definitively</em> indicates a code smell : <strong>this hierarchy blatantly
violates Liskov's principle of substitution</strong> since a class receiving an
instance of a <code>Point</code> expects <code>setX()</code> to work, and may
not handle this exception correctly. Obviously a read-writeable class is
readable, but a readable class is not necessarly a read-writeable class. This
may introduce subtle bugs that would only be catched at runtime, and therefore
testing, as simple as it may be, has to be quite thorough in order not to be
bitten at a inconvenient time.</p>
<p>A good solution that respects Liskov's principle is to redesign the
hierarchy, we'll talk about it just later. But right now, don't despair, you
can have almost the best of the both world : simple, yet <em>almost</em>
respecting Liskov's principle.</p>
<h4>Circus time : ride two horses at once</h4>
<p>Actually what violates Liskov's principle is that the setters don't do the
job they are entitled to do. Throwing an exception is a sure way to
<strong>ensure</strong> that the object won't be modified, but that is usually
overkill<sup>[<a href="#pnote-397655-1" id="rev-pnote-397655-1" name="rev-pnote-397655-1">1</a>]</sup>. If you just log the erroneous call, but
still do what it should do, you have the warnings, but not the nasty
consequences. Just take care to log the callstack also, in order to be able to
fix it much more easily.</p>
<p>The new method becomes then :</p>
<pre>
void setX(int i) {
    Log.warn(new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;PointReadOnly is read-only&quot;));
    return inner.setX(i);
}
</pre>
<p>A notable side effect is that your class isn't really read-only anymore
though, just complain-only.</p>
<h3>The <em>Object-Oriented way</em></h3>
<p>A much better solution is to create a read-only super class that the
read-write one would inherit. The read-only class only implements getters (or
any non-changing method). The read-write complement them with the setters.</p>
<p>It would lead to code like :</p>
<pre>
public class PointReadOnly {
    private final Point inner;
    public PointReadOnly(Point p) { this.inner = p };

    int getX() { return inner.getX(); }
    int getY() { return inner.getY(); }
}

public class Point extends PointReadOnly {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    void setX(int i) { this.x = i; }
    void setY(int i) { this.y = i; }
    int getX() { return this.x; }
    int getY() { return this.y; }
}
</pre>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>Now <strong>Liskov's principle is not violated anymore</strong> and code
that expects a read-only class can seamlessly have a r/o or a r/w class.</p>
<p>The changing will also spread naturally all throughout the codebase, just
like the C++ <code>const</code> modifier and failures to comply would be caught
at <strong>compile time</strong> and not at runtime.</p>
<p>The r/o is a nice wrapper for the read-only class, and a r/w can even be
used in place of the r/o place.</p>
<h4>Disadvantages</h4>
<p>It doesn't <em>feel</em> right :The r/o class is just a placeholder for a
r/w class.</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>An interface-base inheritance scheme can even be better. <code>Point</code>
as the r/o interface, <code>PointMutable</code> as the r/w and
<code>PointBase</code> as the base implentation class. This way you can avoid
the wrapper class. You also get the C++ <code>const_cast&lt;&gt;()</code> for
free (by just downcasting as <code>PointMutable</code>).</p>
<pre>
interface Point {
        int getX();
        int getY();
}
interface PointMutable extends Point {
        void setX(int i);
        void setY(int i);
}
class PointBase implements Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    void setX(int i) { this.x = i; }
    void setY(int i) { this.y = i; }
    int getX() { return this.x; }
    int getY() { return this.y; }
}
</pre>
<p>I realize this does not answer your question about getting rid of the
warnings. But warnings can either be suppressed, ignored, or addressed. An
unused parameter is often a bad smell that indicates your method might not be
doing what it's expected to do. Methods should only get essential parameters.
If the parameter is not used, the parameter is not essential, and therefore
something needs to be changed.</p>
<h3>The <em><code>String</code> way</em></h3>
<p>Another way is just to avoid the read-only and mutable API all together and
go the functional way. Since it's a completely different paradigm, it doesn't
exactly fits the bill here but it's a quite important way of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot" hreflang="en">cutting the gordian
knot</a>. Its concepts are rooted in both functional programming and RAII. It
is quite practical only if you have an efficient garbage collection system,
since it has the tendency to create lots of temporary objets that are mostly
created, used and forgot.</p>
<p>Do do thing, you have to redesign the whole class, in order to be able to
defined it only once, and when you call a modifying method, you end up with an
other object, also immutable. The <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code> and
<code>Class</code> class make extensive usage of this.</p>
<p>So, our class will become :</p>
<pre>
class final Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;
    Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }
    int getX() { return this.x; }
    int getY() { return this.y; }

    void setX(int i) { return new Point(i, this.y); }
    void setY(int i) { return new Point(this.x, i); }
}
</pre>
<p>As you can see, every object is not modifiable, if a method recieves the
object as an argument, it cannot modify it, since it would have a new object.
The properties are final, and the class has usually to be made final in order
not to be able to mutate the class by inheritance.</p>
<p>This enables programming without side-effect and therefore is quite
interesting for multi-thread programming.</p>
<h2>Conclusion &amp; thoughts</h2>
<p>The <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> is a very practical idiom,
that even the Java Collection API is based on it. It may not be very nice in
theory, but in practice it has its usages. It should not be abused thought, and
the <em>OO</em>-way should be prefered when possible, usually when you are in
control of all the code base.</p>
<p>The logging approch doesn't really solve the problem since it's only
advisory, but can fit the bill when the code base is huge and you want to be
able to understand what is going wrong.</p>
<p>The <em>OO</em>-way is a nice compromise between the abstract beauty of the
String-way and the quite hugly kludge of the <em>Collection</em>-way,
especially when used with the interfaces scheme : it spreads out as the
<code>const</code> param, and force the coder to think if a modifying is really
needed.</p>
<p>The <em>String</em>-way is very tempting, as a true create-and-forget way.
If you could even enforce to only have one instance of each representation
you'll have a free <code>==</code> (almost) overloaded operator<sup>[<a href="#pnote-397655-2" id="rev-pnote-397655-2" name="rev-pnote-397655-2">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>So we have at least 3 ways to learn and adapt idioms from C++ in Java. The
major issue is that it's not as itegrated as <code>const</code> : every object
needs custom code except maybe the <em>String</em>-way.</p>

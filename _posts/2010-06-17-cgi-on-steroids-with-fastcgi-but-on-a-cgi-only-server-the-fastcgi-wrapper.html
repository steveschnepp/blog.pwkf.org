<h2>FastCGI is really <em>CGI on steroids</em></h2>
<p>FastCGI is very common way to increase performance of a CGI installation. It
is based on the fact that usually the startup of CGI scripts is slow, whereas
the response is quite fast.</p>
<p>So if you have a persistent process, you only have to take care of the
startup once, and you then experience a real speedup.</p>
<h3>FastCGI vs mod_perl (or mod_python, ...)</h3>
<p>Once a big fan of <code>mod_perl</code>, I'm converted to FastCGI since.
<code>mod_perl</code> was for a long time <strong>the</strong> answer for
speeding up Perl CGI scripts. It has a very good track record of stability and
has real hooks deep in the Apache processing requests.</p>
<p>FastCGI focuses on a different feature set that is more actual than
<code>mod_perl</code><sup>[<a href="#pnote-527747-1" id="rev-pnote-527747-1" name="rev-pnote-527747-1">1</a>]</sup> :</p>
<ul>
<li>It is much simpler to install and configure, especially when having
multiple applications.</li>
<li>Able to connect to a distant server (running as a different UID, chrooted
or even on a remote host)</li>
<li>Able to mix scripting languages without any need to compile some other
apache modules.</li>
<li>Able to be used with several webservers, even closed-source ones : FastCGI
is a protocol, not an API.</li>
</ul>
<h2>But steroids do have some side effects</h2>
<h3>CGI issues</h3>
<p>One downside is that your CGI script should be adapted to FastCGI and the
fact that the script doesn't end with the end of the request.</p>
<p>In the real world that's quite easy. Every language that is commonly used
for CGI offers <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/5" hreflang="en">CGI-wrapper libraries</a> that works in a FastCGI context as well as a
plain CGI one.</p>
<h3>Webserver issues</h3>
<p>Another issue can also come from the webserver. Since CGI is dead simple to
implement even the micro-webserver <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/" hreflang="en">thttpd</a> implements
it.</p>
<p>FastCGI on the other hand is a little more difficult to implement, since the
webserver needs to create a container that monitors and calls the
FastCGI-enabled script.</p>
<h3>A standalone FastCGI container</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the FastCGI team provided us with a ready-to-use container and
a very simple client that acts a plain CGI script, but proxies it to a
full-blown container.</p>
<p>Since the plain CGI part is a very small native executable its overhead is
negligible compared to the reply time, even without comparison with the startup
time of the whole script.</p>
<p>Its installation is also quite straightforward. I just installed the
<code>libfcgi</code> package on Debian : it provides
<code>/usr/bin/cgi-fcgi</code>.</p>
<p>I created a simple CGI wrapper for my previous <a href="/post/2010/06/Waiting-for-Munin-2.0-Performance-FastCGI">munin
benchmarking</a> needs :</p>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

exec /usr/bin/cgi-fcgi -connect /tmp/munin-cgi.sock \
     /usr/lib/cgi-bin/munin-cgi-graph
</pre>

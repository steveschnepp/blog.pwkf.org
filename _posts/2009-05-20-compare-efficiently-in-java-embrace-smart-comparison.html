<p>Bill the Lizard shows us <a href="http://www.billthelizard.com/2008/08/avoid-npe-when-comparing-strings.html" hreflang="en">a nice trick to avoid this NPE</a> when used with string literals
: call the method on the string literal. It's possible because it's also an
object, and cannot be <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>But, as much as this trick code seems sweet, but it just feels like a red
herring on the long run, First it only works for comparing strings and even
only when comparing a string with a string literal.</p>
<h2>To Equality ...</h2>
<p>It is what he said at the end that is much more interesting :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lesson to be learned here is that if you have to resort to &quot;clever&quot;
tricks to get something done, with just a little bit of lateral thinking you
can probably find a cleaner, simpler way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's take this lesson even further.</p>
<p>I had a Perl &amp; C++ background before coming to the Java world, and I am
sometimes puzzled that Java makes things quite unnecessary complicated for the
programmer from time to time.</p>
<p>My little suggestion : create a quite simple helper static function :</p>
<pre>
static boolean isEqual(String a, String b) {
   if (a == b) return true;

   // a &amp; b cannot be null at the same time
   if (a == null || b == null) return false;

   // Now none can be null
   return a.equals(b);
}
</pre>
<p>Now, the NPE is avoided for any kind of string, with any order. We could
also have a <em>smarter</em> equality comparison function by first converting
to a string, and comparing the resulting string instead of comparing the
original numbers.</p>
<pre>
static boolean isEqualSmart(Object a, Object b) {
   if (a == b) return true;

   // a &amp; b cannot be null at the same time
   if (a == null || b == null) return false;

   // Now none can be null
   return a.toString().equals(b.toString());
}
</pre>
<p>With the wonders of Java's function overloading, you can even write
specialized functions that convert even more <em>smartly</em> their arguments.
And then be able to compare a string with a number (even a primitive type).</p>
<h2>... and Beyond</h2>
<p>We began about testing equality, but for comparison such as
<code>&lt;=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>, you have to decode the output of the
quite ugly <code>compareTo()</code> method. The helper static function trick
comes also handy here.</p>
<p>First, we design a complete API that enable alphanumeric, and numeric
comparison : the so-called <strong>smart comparison</strong>. The API should
take any Object, or even primitive types, and convert it at will to enable
hybrid comparison. This will greatly enhance the comparisons abilities of
Java.</p>
<pre>
class OpAlpha {

   // Alphanumeric comparison
   public static boolean lt(Object a, Object b) {
      /* convert to string and compare */
   }
   public static boolean gt(Object a, Object b) {
      /* convert to string and compare */
   }

   // ... rest of the implementation ...
}


class OpNum {

   // numeric comparison
   public static boolean lt(Object a, Object b) {
      /* convert to numeric and compare */
   }

   // ... rest of the implementation ...
}

class Op {
   // smart comparison, depends on the 2nd argument type
   public static boolean lt(Object a, int b) {
      /* convert to int and compare */
   }
   public static boolean lt(Object a, String b) {
      /* convert to string and compare */
   }
   public static boolean lt(Object a, Number b) {
      /* convert to Number and compare */
   }

   // ... rest of the implementation ...
}
</pre>
<p>The usage is like this :</p>
<pre>
String a = &quot;124&quot;;
assertTrue( Op.eq(a, 124) );
assertFalse( Op.lt(a, 1) );
assertTrue( OpAlpha.lt(a, 1) );
</pre>
<p>We can see that all the tedious part of handling the conversions is done
under the hood. Choosing the comparison to is just a matter of choosing the
right class. A little more work could even be done to take the <code>Op</code>
classes to implement <code>Comparator</code> in a complete OO way in addition
of the static helpers.</p>
<h2>Update (01/06/2009)</h2>
<p>It seems that <a href="/post/2009/06/Equality-in-Java-is-a-Hot-Topic-but-a-Hazardous-one">equality in
Java is quite hazardous</a>, and that you have to be extra careful not to set a
comparison-land-mine off by accident.</p>

Comparing Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) to the Food Industry offers an
interesting analogy. From similar behavioral patterns to comparable
consequences, let's explore that analogy further.

# Resisting a trip to the candy shop

A very common analogy is to use GitHub as a candy shop.

When you need to code something, it is very easy to go to GitHub. You'll mostly
always find something that suits your needs.

Moreover, in the modern stacks, it is every easier to integrate that code to
your codebase. It's just a `npm` or `maven` install away.

Falling for such instant gratification is expected, as
1. it solves immediatly the problem at hand
2. Using a library is always better than writing it yourself, so you can make
   the maintenance someone's else problem.
3. It's free anyway, so it won't affect the bottom line.



# Running a reputable restaurant

Imagine that you own a restaurant. You find some mushrooms & berries on your
way to there.  Those look delicious, and moreover **free**. So, you pick them
and decide to add them to your daily dishes.  But who ensure that those are
safe for your customers ? What will happen if they are not ?

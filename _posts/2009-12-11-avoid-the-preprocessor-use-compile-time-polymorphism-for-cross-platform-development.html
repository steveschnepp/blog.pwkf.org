<p>We'll take a very simple file I/O subsystem here as an example
(<code>open</code>, <code>close</code>). We'll also only take Linux and
Windows, since that's usually the 2 most common platforms people want to
develop for<sup>[<a href="#pnote-467153-1" id="rev-pnote-467153-1" name="rev-pnote-467153-1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2>The usual abstraction with the preprocessor</h2>
<p>Usually preprocessor <code>#ifdef</code>s are used to compile specific parts
for the underlying OS.</p>
<p>The file <code>fileiosys.cpp</code> looks<sup>[<a href="#pnote-467153-2" id="rev-pnote-467153-2" name="rev-pnote-467153-2">2</a>]</sup> like the one below
:</p>
<pre>
fileiosys_filedesc open(char* filename) {
#ifdefine __WIN32__
    return OpenFile(
        filename,
        GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
        FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
        NULL,
    );
#else // UNIX
    return open(filename, O_READ | O_WRITE, 0666);
#endif
}

int close (fileiosys_filedesc fd) {
#ifdefine __WIN32__
    return CloseHandle(fd) ? 0 : -1;
#else // UNIX
    return close(fd);
#endif
}
</pre>
<p>The header <code>fileiosys.h</code> looks then like :</p>
<pre>
// Define a custom file descriptor
#ifdefine __WIN32__
    #define fileiosys_filedesc HANDLE
#else // UNIX
    #define fileiosys_filedesc int
#endif

fileiosys_filedesc open(char* filename);
int close(fileiosys_filedesc fd);
</pre>
<h2>Avoid the preprocessor Compile-time polymorphism</h2>
<p>As the previous little example, the code isn't really easy to read. You have
to always think which environnement you are in. All the specifics are
multiplexed in the same file, and the programmer has to always demultiplex it
in real time each time he reads the code.</p>
<p>The last part of the interface file is quite simple to read since it's
already abstracted away. Now let's completely demultiplex the implementation in
several implementation files.</p>
<h3>The header file is the common interface</h3>
<p>The interface is the most important part of the design. It should be
high-level enough to mask the differences between the plateforms you want to
support, but not too high-level, otherwise you'll end up duplicating to much
code.</p>
<p>So, for our file I/O subsystem, we'll just abstract the usual syscalls
<code>open</code>, <code>close</code> in the same way as before.</p>
<p>The parameters that are passed through the interface are also very
important. You cannot usually leak a platform-specific structure. So here all
the file descriptors are just an opaque handle, represented by a pointer to a
structure defined only as a forward declaration in the header. This pattern,
sometimes called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer" hreflang="en">pimpl idiom</a>, enables use to really share the representation
while implementing it differently.</p>
<p>The header file is preserved as <code>fileiosys.h</code>, whereas the
implementation is in the files <code>linux/fileiosys.cpp</code> and
<code>win32/fileiosys.cpp</code></p>
<h4><code>fileiosys.h</code></h4>
<pre>
// Define the forward declaration
struct fis_filedesc;
fis_filedesc* open(char* filename);
int close(struct fis_filedesc* fd);
</pre>
<h4><code>win32/fileiosys.cpp</code></h4>
<pre>
struct fis_filedesc {
    HANDLE handle;
};

fis_filedesc* open(char* filename) {
    fis_filedesc* fd = new fis_filedesc();
    fd-&gt;handle = OpenFile(
        filename,
        GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE,
        FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE,
        NULL,
    );

    return fd;
}

int close (struct fis_filedesc* fd) {
    int retval = CloseHandle(fd-&gt;handle) ? 0 : -1;
    delete(fd);
    return retval;
}
</pre>
<h4><code>linux/fileiosys.cpp</code></h4>
<pre>
struct fis_filedesc {
    int file_descriptor;
};

static fis_filedesc[32];

fis_filedesc* open(char* filename) {
    fis_filedesc* fd = new fis_filedesc();
    fd-&gt;file_descriptor = open(filename, O_READ | O_WRITE, 0666);
    return fd;
}

int close (struct fis_filedesc* fd) {
    int retval = close(fd);
    delete(fd);
    return retval;
}
</pre>
<h4>The build system : <code>Makefile</code></h4>
<p>The makefile should take into account the different platforms, and only
compile the needed implementation file. All the gluing magic will then be done
at linking time instead of preprocessor time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The interest of have multiple implementation files is obvious. It is
<strong>much</strong> more straightforward to read and only marginally harder
to write. But since most of the time code is read and not written, the choose
is quite a no-brainer.</p>
<p>The nicest part is that all this is possible even without the expensive
run-time polymorphism and RTTI, since the choose is done at compile-time.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-467153-1" id="pnote-467153-1" name="pnote-467153-1">1</a>] actually when targeting Linux, you usually target all
Unix-like systems since they already have POSIX as a common abstraction</p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-467153-2" id="pnote-467153-2" name="pnote-467153-2">2</a>] The code is not real, it has been sweetened</p>

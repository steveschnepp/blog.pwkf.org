<p>The search engine ranking of a web site is very important nowadays. As
usually every optimisation means an complexification of the code, many
developpers just pay that price. It's mostly paid with a
<em>javascriptification</em> of the links that we don't want to be followed,
and <em>javascriptification</em> of functional dialog popups.</p>
<p>There's an other approch to this. It still makes heavy use of Javascript,
but :</p>
<ul>
<li>your site will still work as intended even with javascript disabled</li>
<li>your site will be much more maintenable</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to post-process the links with a Javascript function that is
triggered just before the end of the loading of the page. Usually it can be
done with a body-onLoad, or a &lt;script/&gt; element at the bottom of the
page. This script parses all the &lt;a/&gt; elements, and decodes the classes
added to it. If you encode the classenames like this code :</p>
<pre>
&lt;a
href=&quot;my_popup.html&quot;
class=&quot;medium_popup pp/popup&quot;&gt;
        explain these words
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>We can see that the classes of the link are <code>medium_popup</code>, that
is handled normally by the browser, and <code>pp/popup</code> is used by the
post-processing code to add a onClick() handler that could be expressed as
<code>onClick=&quot;javascript:open_popup('my_popup.html');return
false;&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>The big advantage is that you can very simply add popup to your links,
web-spiders knows how to go to your popup with all your shiny glossary, and so
can users without javascript or just open in a new tab with a middle-click on
some browsers.</p>
<p>If it's a dialog box to ask some more informations, you can encode the link
like that :</p>
<pre>
&lt;a
href=&quot;&quot;
class=&quot;medium_popup pp/link/my_dialog.html&quot;&gt;
        choose the date
&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>This way <code>pp/link/my_dialog.html</code> will be parsed and the
<code>href</code> will be dynamically replaced with
<code>my_dialog.html</code>.</p>
<p>You can even later add a <code>pp/popup</code> after the
<code>pp/link/my_dialog.html</code>, and have the dialob box magically opened
in a popup.</p>
<p>I'll post later some example code to parse it.</p>

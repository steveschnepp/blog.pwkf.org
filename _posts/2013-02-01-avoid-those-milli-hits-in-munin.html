<p>A recurring question on IRC is : <q>why do I have 500 million hit/s in my
graph ?</q>.</p>
<p>Turns out that they are really seeing <code>500m hit/s</code>, and that
lower-case <code>m</code> means <em>milli</em>, and not <em>Mega</em> as
specified in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix" hreflang="en">Metric system</a>. This is automatically done by RRD.</p>
<p>To avoid this you should just specify <code>graph_scale no</code> as
<a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/graph_scale" hreflang="en">specified</a>.</p>

<p>I'm always wondering why all textbooks and reference material on the web
always describe inheritance with the same kind of example :</p>
<pre>
class A {
        public execute() {
                // do something...
        }
}
</pre>
<pre>
class B extends A {
        public execute() {
                // initialize for B
                super.execute();
        }
}
</pre>
<pre>
class C extends A {
        public execute() {
                // initialize for B
                super.execute();
        }
}
</pre>
<p>One thing struck me : if I want to have some code executed
<strong>before</strong> <code>execute()</code> in every class, such as
preparing the graphic context for example, I have to write a protected method
<code>initializeContext()</code> on the base class and call it from every
derived <code>execute()</code> method. This is a good candidate for errors
since it's manual and therefore not automatic.</p>
<p>I prefer to go for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control" hreflang="en">IoC</a>-like
inheritance scheme, we could call it &quot;Inversion of Inheritance&quot;. The code would
be something like :</p>
<p>class A {</p>
<pre>
   protected executePre() {
                // Default implementation
                // does nothing
        }
</pre>
<pre>
   protected executePost() {
                // Default implementation
                // does nothing
        }
</pre>
<pre>
   protected executeInternal()     {
                // do something
        }

        public final execute() {
                executePre();
                executeInternal();
                executePost();
        }
}
</pre>
<pre>
class B extends A {
        protected executeInternal() {
                // initialize for B
        }
}
</pre>
<pre>
class C extends A {
        protected executeInternal() {
                // initialize for C
        }
}
</pre>
<p>There are 2 problems with this approach :</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a little performance penalty since every calls issues 3 virtual
calls.</li>
<li>If you want to add another interception function, you have to edit the base
class.</li>
</ol>
<p>But the main purpose is that <strong>you</strong> are in control of the
derived classes of your class since the creativity of the reuser is severly
hampered. I think of it as the most easy way to enforce the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" hreflang="en">Liskov substitution principle</a>.</p>

<p>In my previous post I explained how to <a href="/post/2014/01/Tutorial-Setup-a-dev-environment-for-Munin">setup a simple
development environment</a>, but I feel that's a little too much if you only
want to try that new, shiny, munin version.</p>
<p>So, let's assume that you're on a debian-derivative distribution (Ubuntu,
Raspbian, ... , and of course Debian).</p>
<p>The nicest news is that 2.1.x already hit the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental" hreflang="en">experimental part of
Debian</a>. That makes it <strong>very</strong> easy to use as everything is
described there.</p>
<p>I'll just copy/paste some instructions tailored for munin, please refer to
the original page if you'd like to learn more.</p>
<h3>Add experimental to your sources.list</h3>
<pre>
echo &quot;deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian experimental main&quot; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>
<h3>Update the apt database</h3>
<pre>
apt-update
</pre>
<h3>Install the experimental version of munin</h3>
<pre>
apt-get -t experimental install munin
</pre>
<h3>Pin the munin as the experimental version</h3>
<p>That works quite well, but the munin package won't be updated, as the
automatic upgrades only comes from the non-experimental part. And obviously the
version there is lower than the experimental one.</p>
<p>So, that is called package <strong>pinning</strong>, that is to
<strong>pin</strong> a certain package in a certain repository. It is still
very simple to do :</p>
<pre>
cat &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/preferences &lt;&lt;EOF
Package: munin
Pin: release a=experimental
Pin-Priority: 800
EOF
</pre>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, that's it. You have successfully upgraded to the unstable side of
munin...</p>

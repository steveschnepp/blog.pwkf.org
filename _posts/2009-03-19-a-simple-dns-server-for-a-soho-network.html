<p>I'm in search of a very simple DNS Server for a small network. It should be
:</p>
<ul>
<li>recursive &amp; caching (can be used as a proxy)</li>
<li>very simple administration (parsing /etc/hosts would be perfect, raw DNS
zones like BIND would be a little bit overkill)</li>
<li>quite lightweight (aka no dependency on an SQL engine like MySQL, such as
MyDNS)</li>
<li>Seamless integration to Windows lookups (nmblookup) via proxying functions
(DNS to/from NMB)</li>
</ul>

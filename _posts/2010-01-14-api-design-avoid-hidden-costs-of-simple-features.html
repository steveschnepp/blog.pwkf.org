<p><strong>Programmers</strong> are usually like water : they <strong>always
use</strong> the <strong>path of least resistance</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's see how to use this fact to predict the usage of an API when you
design it.</p>
<h2>Initial API</h2>
<p>Consider the very simple DB API that consumes a connected ResultSet and
presents a disconnected version of it.</p>
<pre>
class DisconnectedResultSet{
        public DisconnectedResultSet (ResultSet rs);
        public boolean next();
        public Object getObject(int col_idx);
}
</pre>
<p>It's usage is quite easy :</p>
<pre>
while (drs.next()) {
        int col_idx = 1;
        drs.getObject(col_idx++); // Do something w/ 1st col
        drs.getObject(col_idx++); // Do something w/ 2st col
        //...
}
</pre>
<h2>Just a <em>little</em> evolution...</h2>
<p>Since the <code>DisconnectedResultSet</code> is <em>disconnected</em>, we
can imagine that it should implement a <code>rewind()</code> method in order to
use it several times without running the initial query again. We now have an
updated class :</p>
<pre>
class DisconnectedResultSet{
        public DisconnectedResultSet (ResultSet rs);
        public boolean next();
        public Object getObject(int col_idx);
        public void rewind(); // Be able to rewind it
}
</pre>
<p>And its classical usage :</p>
<pre>
while (drs.next()) {
        // do stuff...
}
// ...
drs.rewind();
while (drs.next()) {
        // do something else with the same data...
}
// ...
drs.rewind();
while (drs.next()) {
        // do something else with the same data...
}
// ...
</pre>
<h2>A new need comes</h2>
<p>A new need comes : see if the <code>DisconnectedResultSet</code> is empty or
not in order to avoid sending header.</p>
<p>The usual way is to send them once when iterating like :</p>
<pre>
boolean is_headers_sent = false;
while (drs.next()) {
        if (! is_headers_sent) {
                send_headers();
                is_headers_sent = true;
        }
        // do something else with the same data...
}
</pre>
<p>But since there is a nice <code>rewind()</code>method, just waiting to be
used, the code might become :</p>
<pre>
if (drs.next()) {
        send_headers();
}
drs.rewind();
while (drs.next()) {
        // do something else with the same data...
}
</pre>
<p>Now, this code isn't generic anymore to accommodate a connected
ResultSet.</p>
<p>So, as John Carmack said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost of adding a feature isn't just the time it takes to code it. The
cost also includes the addition of an obstacle to future expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's really true when you design <strong>APIs</strong> since their purpose
is to <strong>last long</strong> and to <strong>be extended</strong>.</p>
<p>So, <strong>think twice when you propose an extension &quot;just in
case&quot;</strong>.</p>
<h2>The <em>little</em> evolution, revisited...</h2>
<p>To solve this case, don't propose a <code>rewind()</code> method, but offer
a <code>duplicate()</code> one. It offers the same functionality, just in a new
object.</p>
<p>The usage will be almost the same as shown below, but since it feels more
performance-sensitive, it won't be used as lightly : the <code>boolean
is_headers_sent</code> pattern has now more chances to be used.</p>
<pre>
while (drs.next()) {
        // do stuff...
}
// ...
drs = drs.duplicate();
while (drs.next()) {
        // do something else with the same data...
}
// ...
drs = drs.duplicate();
while (drs.next()) {
        // do something else with the same data...
}
// ...
</pre>
<p>It's an other example that <a href="/post/2007/12/03/Use-immutable-objects-to-avoid-synchronisation">immutable
objects are the way to go</a>, but for a different reason this time.</p>
<p>Note: Just finished my March 2010 article, even <strong>on time</strong>...
I'm still trying to keep at least a one article per month blogging rate. So far
so good for 2010, still 9 months to go !</p>

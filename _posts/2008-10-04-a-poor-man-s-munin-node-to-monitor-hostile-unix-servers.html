<p><a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/" hreflang="en">Munin</a> is a nice
monitoring system. Simple but quite effective. It's main selling point is the
UNIX-esque simplicity of the architecture. You can just <a href="http://sysmonblog.co.uk/?p=17" hreflang="en">create a new plugin</a> in a
matter of minutes to monitor whatever you can imagine.</p>
<p>There is even a <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/" hreflang="en">comprehensive collection</a> of plugins ready to use (admittedly
of various quality).</p>
<h2>Various platform are supported</h2>
<p>Usually the main issue is the <em>MuninNode</em>, an agent (daemon) that
runs on the server to be monitored, since it is responsible of translating the
request of the munin server (the one with the graphs) to the various plugins,
build-ins or external. The ease of installing this agent depends on the OS and
the access you have on the server :</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>For Windows you can install <a href="http://www.jory.info/serendipity/index.php?/categories/4-Munin-Node-for-Windows" hreflang="en">munin-node-win32</a>.</p>
<h3>Unix (with root access)</h3>
<p>For Unix when you are root, usually there is a package ready to install in
your distribution, or from the source.</p>
<h3>Others (Hostile servers)</h3>
<p>On <em>hostile</em> servers, you don't usually have a root access and no
easy acces to a compiler.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="https://github.com/munin-monitoring/contrib/tree/master/tools/pmmn/" hreflang="en">pmmn (Poor Man's Munin Node)</a>, a little vanilla Perl script that
emulates the core functionality of the real munin-node script, but without
having to install many Perl CPAN modules.</p>
<p>It has also a nice functionality : it is possible to communicate via
stdin/stdout instead of a TCP port. This way it is very easy to monitor hosts
that are behind a firewall without opening (and monitoring) many tunnels.</p>
<h2>Installation of <strong>pmmn</strong></h2>
<p>Suppose you have access to the server via a supervision user (let's say
<em>supusr</em>). Installation of <strong>pmmn</strong> is quite easy : just
copy the files somewhere on the disk where you have access, for example
(<em>/home/supusr</em>).</p>
<h3>TCP installation</h3>
<p>Just launch the server with <strong>-p 4949</strong> and declare it in the
<strong>munin.conf</strong> file on your munin-server. This solution is quite
equivalent to a regular munin-node installation.</p>
<h3>Tunnel installation</h3>
<p>Same as the TCP, but you have to <a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/MuninSSHTunneling" hreflang="en">create a
TCP tunnel via SSH</a> to be able to reach the munin-node.</p>
<h3>Inetd+SSH installation</h3>
<p>It is a mix between <a href="http://munin.projects.linpro.no/wiki/MuninInetdBouncing" hreflang="en">port
forwarding via inetd</a> and the Tunnel-based previously discussed.</p>
<p>You first have to <a href="http://www.laubenheimer.net/ssh-keys.shtml" hreflang="en">established a key-based SSH authentication</a> without passphrase
(you will not be there to type it) from <em>supusr</em> on the inet server
(usually the munin-node one) to the user <em>supusr</em> on the server to be
monitored.</p>
<p>For example, to monitor <em>server1</em> and <em>server2</em>, in the file
/etc/inetd.conf, you have to add lines :</p>
<pre>
7001   stream  tcp     nowait  supusr /usr/bin/ssh -- supusr@server1 /home/suprusr/pmmn/pmmn.pl
7002   stream  tcp     nowait  supusr /usr/bin/ssh -- supusr@server2 /home/suprusr/pmmn/pmmn.pl
</pre>
<p>Then, in the <em>munin.conf</em> file of the MuninServer, you just have to
declare the new nodes :</p>
<pre>
[server1]
    address localhost
    port 7001
[server2]
    address localhost
    port 7002
</pre>
<p>The MuninServer will now set up a stdin/stdout SSH tunnel transparently and
launch the <strong>pmmn</strong> server when needed. You are now free to write
plugins like if a real munin-node where installed. The only restriction is that
y ou don't have a root access, so you are limited in the information you may
collect.</p>

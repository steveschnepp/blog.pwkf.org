<h2>KISS is the core design of Munin</h2>
<p>Munin's greatest strength is its very KISS architecture. It therefore gets
many things right, such as a huge modularity.</p>
<p>Each component (master/node/plugin) has a simple API to communicate with the
others.</p>
<h2>Spin-offs ...</h2>
<p>I admit that the master, even the node, have convoluted code. In fact some
rewrites already do exist.</p>
<h3>... are welcomed ...</h3>
<p>And they are a really good thing, as it enables rapid prototyping on things
that the stock munin has (currently) trouble to do.</p>
<p>The stock munin is a piece of software that many depend upon, so it has to
move at a much slower pace than one does want, even me. As much as I really
want to add many many features to it, I still have to take extra care that it
doesn't break stuff, even the least known features.</p>
<p>So I take munin off-springs very seriously and even offer as much help as I
can in order for them to succeed.</p>
<h3>... because they are very valuable in the long term</h3>
<p>In my opinion competition is only short bad in the short term, and in the
long term they usually add significant value to the whole ecosystem. That said,
there's always a risk to become slowly irrelevant, but I think that's the real
power of open-source's evolutionary paradigm : embrace them or become obsolete
and get replaced.</p>
<p>Since, if someone takes the time to author a competitor that has a real
threat potential, it mostly means that there's a real itch to scratch and that
many things are to be learnt.</p>
<h2>Different layers of spin-offs</h2>
<p>The munin ecosystem is divided in 3 main categories, obviously related to
the 3 main components of munin : master, node &amp; plugin.</p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>That's the most obvious part as custom plugins are the real <em>bread and
butter</em> of munin.</p>
<p>Stock plugins are mostly written in Perl or POSIX shell, as Perl is munin's
own language and POSIX shell is ubiquitous. That fact is acknowledged by the
fact that core munin provides 2 libraries (Perl &amp; Shell) to help plugin
authoring.</p>
<p>So, it's quite natural that each mainstream language has grown its own
plugin library. Some language even have <a href="https://github.com/aouyar/PyMunin" hreflang="en">two</a> of <a href="https://github.com/samuel/python-munin" hreflang="en">them</a>.</p>
<h4>C</h4>
<p>Some plugins got even rewritten in plain C, as it was shown that shell
plugins do have a significant impact on very under-powered nodes, such as
embedded routers.</p>
<h3>Node</h3>
<p>This component is very simple. Yet, it has to be run on all the nodes that
one wants to monitor. It is currently written in Perl, and while that's not an
issue on UNIX-like systems, it can be quite problematic on embedded ones</p>
<h4>Simple munin</h4>
<p>The official package comes with a POSIX shell rewrite that has to be run
from inetd. It is quite useful for embedded routers like OpenWRT, but still
suffers from an hard dep on POSIX shell and inetd.</p>
<h4>SNMP</h4>
<p>SNMP is another way to monitor nodes. While it works really well, it mostly
suffers the fact that its configuration is quite different of the usual way, so
I guess some things will change on that side.</p>
<h4>Win32 ports</h4>
<p>Win32 has long been a very difficult OS to monitor, as it doesn't offer much
of the UNIX-esque features. Yet the number of win32 nodes that one wants to
monitor is quite high, as it makes munin one the few systems that can easily
monitor heterogeneous systems.</p>
<p>Therefore, while you can install the stock munin-node, several projects
emerged. We decided to adopt <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/browser/munin-node-win32" hreflang="en">munin-node-win32</a>.</p>
<h4>Android</h4>
<p>There's also a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/silverchris/Android-Munin-Node" hreflang="en">node for
Android</a>. It makes sense, given that the Android is yet Linux-derived, but
lacks Perl, and is a Java mostly platform. This node also has some basic
capabilities of pushing data to the master instead of the usual polling.</p>
<p>This is specially interesting given the fact that Android nodes are usually
loosely connected, so the node spools values itself and pushes them when it
recovers connectivity.</p>
<p>Note that this is specifically an aspect that is currently lacking in munin,
and I'm planning to address it in the 2.1 series. So thanks to its author for
showing a relevant use-case.</p>
<h4>C</h4>
<p>That's my last experiment. It started with a simple question : <em>how
difficult would it be to code a fairly portable version of the node ?</em></p>
<p>It turned out that it wasn't that difficult. I'm even asking myself about
eventually replacing the win32 specific port with this one, as the code is much
simpler. The win32 node has several plugin built-in mostly due to platform
specifics. I still have to find a way to work my way around it, but it's in
quite good shape.</p>
<p>This post was originally done to promote it, but while writing it I noticed
that the ecosystem deserved a post on its own. So I'll write another one,
specific to the C port of munin-node and plugins.</p>
<h3>Master</h3>
<p>The master is the most complex component. So rewrites of it won't happen
as-is. They usually take the form of a bridge between the munin protocol and
another graphing system, such as Graphite.</p>
<h4>Clients</h4>
<p>There are also client libraries that are able to directly query munin nodes,
to be able to reuse the vast ecosystem. Languages are various, from the obvious
<a href="http://julien.danjou.info/projects/pymunincli/" hreflang="en">Python</a> to <a href="https://github.com/sosedoff/munin-ruby" hreflang="en">Ruby</a>, along with a quite modern <a href="https://github.com/Redpill-Linpro/node-munin-client">node.js</a> one.</p>

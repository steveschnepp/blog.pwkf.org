`s3cmd` is the standard tool to access S3. Yet it isn't packaged for MSYS2. Here are the steps to use it nonetheless.

# Install

    # Need to install extra python packages
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-python-dateutil mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ca-certificates

    cd s3cmd
    git clone https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd
    ./s3cmd --configure

# Usage

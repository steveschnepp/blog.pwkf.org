<h2>The good</h2>
<ul>
<li>With SMS, IM and now Twitter becoming more and more predominant :
<strong>ideas might be given as bullet points</strong></li>
<li>A presentation is much more dense in meaning than a big blob of text, Less
time is required to read the post and <strong>be inspired</strong> by the
content</li>
<li>Blogging is much less time consuming. As Jeff Artwood said <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001160.html" hreflang="en">Quantity
Always Trumps Quality</a>, it is <strong>the commitment</strong> that
<strong>is important</strong> (hence the schedule).</li>
<li>You might divide a long article in several short and related posts.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The bad</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blog</strong> articles are usually a <strong>medium-depth
analysis</strong> of a problem whereas presentation are usually a written
support of a more detailed oral presentation.</li>
<li>Presentation sentences are usually hard to understand since they are just
headlines without the underlying context.</li>
<li>You can always do a <em>fast-reading</em> version by putting the
<strong>important sentences in bold</strong> for all those hasty readers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The ugly</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Longer don't always mean more interesting</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire" hreflang="en">Voltaire</a> said
<q>Perfection is attained by slow degrees; it requires the hand of time.</q>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exupery" hreflang="en">Antoine de Saint-Exupery</a> completed <q>Perfection is achieved, not when
there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take
away.</q>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As concluded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal" hreflang="en">Pascal</a>, <q>I made this letter longer than usual because I
lack the time to make it shorter</q>, a <strong>good and terse</strong> article
is therefore much <strong>more difficult</strong> to achieve. Therefore
<em>Presentation Style Blogging</em> may be a false good idea.</p>

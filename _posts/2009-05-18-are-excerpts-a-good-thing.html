<p>One thing I'm really wondering is : <q>Should I use excerpts</q> ?</p>
<p>On the plus side :</p>
<ul>
<li>The list is easier to read &amp; shorter to parse. You can then just click
on the link that are interesting to you</li>
<li>I can manage to see which posts are mostly read (useful ?) since the
comments aren't a good indicator<sup>[<a href="#pnote-403185-1" id="rev-pnote-403185-1" name="rev-pnote-403185-1">1</a>]</sup></li>
<li>Mostly all my readers comes from Google. Having a little list and only then
content on a dedicated page seems to help being nicely referenced on more
specifics, hence ususally more relevant topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the down side :</p>
<ul>
<li>The RSS flow and the front page list are truncated. You are one click
further to the whole story.</li>
<li>It seems quite arrogant to force the reader to come to your site.</li>
</ul>
<p>I just edited my articles to have an excerpt when it is quite long.</p>
<p>What do you think ?</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-403185-1" id="pnote-403185-1" name="pnote-403185-1">1</a>] It is <strong>very</strong> far from being a very
famous blog with hordes of readers :-p</p>

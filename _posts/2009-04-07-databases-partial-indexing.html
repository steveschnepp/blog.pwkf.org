<p>Let's take the table that contains orders that we created in <a href="/post/2009/03/Databases%3A-Meta-Data-ctime-mtime">my previous post</a> to show
you some examples.</p>
<p>Orders have usually a state, Let's create it <sup>[<a href="#pnote-391276-1" id="rev-pnote-391276-1" name="rev-pnote-391276-1">1</a>]</sup> :</p>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD COLUMN STATE
</pre>
<p>Now usually a application makes use of the state of the order by querying
it, even quite often. The main problem is that this query will do a full scan
of the table unless the state field is indexed. Here comes the other issue :
indexes take very much space since they have to be ordered and cannot be
trimmed (except throw an expensive DROP/CREATE or REINDEX).</p>
<p>The space used is adequate if the index has many different values, but
usually a state has only a finite set of values, and usually some are very
transient and other quite long. Compare for example the state CANCELLED or
SHIPPED that are mostly final to the very transient state
INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED.</p>
<p>The number of orders that are in the state INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED are quite a
few (especially compared to the final states). However these temporary states
are the mostly queried (usually by batches, pollers or even web pages that
present the workload to the users for <em>manual polling</em>).</p>
<p>Another overlooked usage is to have an <em>ALMOST</em>-UNIQUE index. I mean
an unique index, but only on selected entries. In our ORDERS table, we can add
a field that represent the PRINTING_PID of the process that is responsible for
printing the invoice. It is only unique for the orders that are in the
INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED state. A normal index isn't much of a help here since
either you have to clear it afterwards, but you loose information, or you
cannot enforce any uniqueness.</p>
<p>So there comes the PARTIAL INDEX. It is native in some
databases<sup>[<a href="#pnote-391276-2" id="rev-pnote-391276-2" name="rev-pnote-391276-2">2</a>]</sup> but in most it isn't. Triggers comes then to
the rescue. Some are not really fond of triggers since many things can happen
undercover, but my moto is to use trigger in order to, and only to, maintain
business-agnostic extra datas (usually to cope automatically with
denormalization). Triggers shall not <strong>change</strong> the data, merely
copy and/or move it around.</p>
<p>The new <em>almost-unique</em> column is also created :</p>
<pre>
ALTER TABLE ORDERS ADD COLUMN PRINTING_ID
</pre>
<h2>Implementations</h2>
<h3>Reducing the index size and the overhead</h3>
<p>So, a new table is created to contain the partial index :</p>
<pre>
TABLE PI_ORDERS_STATE (
   INT ORDERS_ID FOREIGN KEY ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID),
   STATE,
   INDEX ON (STATE)
)
</pre>
<p>And the insertion/deletion for the table is done via triggers. I do it a
little rapidly since the real creation is a little more tedious than the
pseudo-code here :</p>
<pre>
CREATE TRIGGER ON ORDERS WHERE INSERT, UPDATE
  WHEN o.STATE not in (PENDING, CANCELLED, SHIPPED)
    INSERT INTO PI_ORDERS_STATE(o.ORDERS_ID, o.STATE) IF ORDERS_ID NOT PRESENT
  ELSE
    DELETE FROM PI_ORDERS_STATE
      WHERE ORDERS_ID = o.ORDERS_ID
</pre>
<p>One should rewrite queries to take advantage of this partial index since
when it's integrated in the database the optimizer just does it himself. A
query like this</p>
<p>Old :</p>
<pre>
SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE ORDERS.STATE = INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED
</pre>
<p>New :</p>
<pre>
SELECT o.* FROM ORDERS o
INNER JOIN PI_ORDERS_STATE p ON p.ORDERS_ID = o.ORDERS_ID p.STATE = INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED
</pre>
<p>The query optimizer should now be able to use the small index in
PI_ORDERS_STATE, and retrieve only the relevant orders via their primary key in
ORDERS.</p>
<h3>Almost-unique colums</h3>
<p>To handle the almost-unique column, it's basically the same idea : a new
table, new triggers :</p>
<pre>
TABLE PI_ORDERS_PRINTING_PID (
   INT ORDERS_ID FOREIGN KEY ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID),
   PRINTING_PID,
   UNIQUE INDEX ON (PRINTING_PID)
)
</pre>
<pre>
CREATE TRIGGER ON ORDERS WHERE INSERT, UPDATE
  WHEN o.STATE = INVOICE_TO_BE_PRINTED
    INSERT INTO PI_ORDERS_PRINTING_PID(o.ORDERS_ID, o.PRINTING_PID) IF ORDERS_ID NOT PRESENT
  ELSE
    DELETE FROM PI_ORDERS_PRINTING_PID
      WHERE ORDERS_ID = o.ORDERS_ID
</pre>
<p>No need to rewrite any query here.</p>

<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-391276-1" id="pnote-391276-1" name="pnote-391276-1">1</a>] Notice that here I don't create all the meta-data
stuff. That is left as an exercise to the reader - Yeah, I
<strong>always</strong> wanted to say that...</p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-391276-2" id="pnote-391276-2" name="pnote-391276-2">2</a>] MS-SQL has it but calls it Filtered Index. PostgreSQL
calls it PARTIAL INDEX. )</p>

<p>This is my first attempt at making a live blog. It should have been a way of
expressing my progress of one of my pet project : <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pwkf/" hreflang="en">Personal
Workflow</a>.</p>
<p>As with every pet projects, there is such an excitation at the beginning,
but after a while it drops rapidely down to zero.</p>
<p>It's quite the same effect when your tendency to postpone is too high as
Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas said : <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html" hreflang="en">Don't Live with Broken
Windows</a> !. It will always be <q>If I could postpone it at that time, I can
still postpone it.</q>, and then it'll take an enormous amount of willpower to
be even started.</p>

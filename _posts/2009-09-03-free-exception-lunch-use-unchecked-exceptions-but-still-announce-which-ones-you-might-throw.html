<p>In a previous article I choosed my side : <a href="/post/2009/07/Checked-or-Unchecked-Exceptions-for-Legacy-Code">Unchecked
Exceptions are much simpler to use</a>.</p>
<p>But, on the other side of this great division, there is a very valid point :
<strong>You usually declare checked exceptions</strong>. Sure it's possible to
only declare to throw <code>Exception</code>, but that would defeat the whole
purpose of using checked exceptions.</p>
<p>The nicest thing is that you can also have a custom exception hierarchy, but
based on <code>RuntimeException</code> instead of a plain
<code>Exception</code>. This way it's like in C++. Everything might be thrown,
and you don't <strong>need</strong> to handle them.</p>
<p><strong>Declaring them</strong>, on the other side, is very interesting
because you are <strong>documenting your interface</strong> for almost
<strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>So, use unchecked exceptions to free yourself of the checked catch-slavery,
but still declare the custom ones you might throw.</p>

In today's world, software development needs to be super flexible but also
stable.  *Fluid teams* are a fresh new idea to help overcome that
contradiction.

# Fluid Teams - A New Chapter in Agile Development

The Fluid Teams design is comprised of 2 very distinct sets of teams :

* Ephemeral Feature teams (EFT)
* Stable Technology teams (STT)

## Ephemeral Feature Teams (EFT)

The Ephemeral Feature Teams are formed by creative minds directly responsible
for creating features.

EFT are **not** long lasting, by design.

* These *Ephemeral Feature Teams* are assembled at the start of an Epic with a
  laser focus on it.
* Then, once the epic is completed, the feature team disperses. This leaves
  room for new associations & therefore new ideas.

The core idea of an EFT is to combine as many specialized skillsets as needed
to be able to design, develop, and *fully* deliver project-based features.

## Stable Technology Teams (STT)

What the feature teams brings in flexibility, Stable Technology Teams brings in
robustness of the codebase.

A STT is formed by *experts* directly responsible for *areas of code*.

This team single purpose is to oversees the integrity of the codebase.  Those
teams are the only ones that have the **merging** .  Therefore they have a
responsibility for effective code reviews to ensure that only high standard
work lands in the codebase.

However, this immense power comes with a trade-off : in return for their
authoritative role in merges, the technology team assumes the full maintenance
within the code areas that their members are responsible for.

This symbiotic relationship creates a balance between empowering fluid teams to
innovate rapidly and ensuring sustainable, high-quality software delivery.

## Summary

|  | EFT | STT
|--|--|--|
| Duration | Short | Long |
| Focus | Features | Maintenance |
| Super Power | Evergreen | Can veto any code merge |
| Critical Weakness | Needs STT approval | Fixes bugs |
| Seniority | Junior/Senior | Senior/Expert |

## Advantages of Fluid Teams

| Advantage | Comment
|--|--|
| Expertise  | As features teams are temporary, you can pick & choose teammates who are great at what exactly the feature needs.
|--|--|
| Innovation | Constantly changing the teams brings new ideas and different ways of doing things each rotation, so everyone is always thinking with a fresh pairs of eyes.
|--|--|
| Adaptability | When business needs change, you can quickly rearrange your teams.
|--|--|
| Happiness | Most team members love working on different projects because they don't get bored and it helps them grow.
|--|--|
| Org Scaling | EFT can serve as testing ground for newcomers. As there's review from STT, they will learn and those that are struggling can be the focus point of management

## Challenges of Fluid Teams

| Challenge | Comment
|--|--|
| Confusion | You need to plan carefully to avoid confusion. Make sure that everyone knows what's going on.
|--|--|
| Disagreements | Keeping the mutual respect between EFT and STT is key to making things work.

Remember that even if the responsabilities are different, the **final objective
is the same**.

Usually the STT is seen as *impeding the release* from the EFT, and the EFT is
seen as *short term coders*.

A good working model is to have a promotion path **from EFT to STT**. This
preserves the creativity of newcomers, but nutures them nicely into the rules
of the organisation by "trial and error" when merging their features.

<p>Actually the tunnel won't disappear, but they will be launched only when
needed and, most importantly configured in <code>munin.conf</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/assets/images/direct_ssh_transport.diff" hreflang="en">native ssh for
munin patch</a> should applies quite cleanly on revision 3101 of the svn
trunk.</p>
<p>Its use is quite straightforward : in <code>/etc/munin/munin.conf</code>,
you just migrate address to the new configuration directive
<code>remote_connection_cmd</code> that take the whole <code>ssh</code> command
to launch a stdio munin-node such as pmmn.</p>
<p>If we take the examples from the previous post, it becomes clear it's
<strong>much</strong> easier to configure.</p>
<h3>munin.conf snippet - Inetd version</h3>
<pre>
[server1]
    address localhost
    port 7001
[server2]
    address localhost
    port 7002
</pre>
<h3>munin.conf snippet - Native SSH transport version</h3>
<p>Right now, the <code>address</code> directive is still mandatory, but
ignored when connecting.</p>
<pre>
[server1]
    address dummy
    remote_connection_cmd /usr/bin/ssh -- supusr@server1 /home/suprusr/pmmn/pmmn.pl
[server2]
    address dummy
    remote_connection_cmd /usr/bin/ssh -- supusr@server2 /home/suprusr/pmmn/pmmn.pl
</pre>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>Beware that the <code>ssh</code> process will now be launched by the
<code>munin</code> user, so you have to update the key-based SSH authentication
accordingly.</p>

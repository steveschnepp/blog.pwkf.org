<p>Having this, knowing the last modification of an item is as easy as querying
this extra information that is updated automatically by the system.</p>
<p>Adaptation to RDBMS is quite easy. Either the RDBMS comes already with the
necessary tools to records this kind of extra information, or it is just a
matter of <em>ghosting</em> the schema with tables that will only contain the
meta-data. The information inside is updated automatically via triggers on the
main table.</p>
<p>An example would be for the <code>ORDERS</code> and <code>ORDER_ITEMS</code>
tables (I don't use a specific SQL dialect, it's just for illustrate purposes.
Just feel free to adapt the code to your favorite database) :</p>
<pre>
TABLE ORDERS (
   SERIAL ORDERS_ID PRIMARY KEY,
   MONEY PRICE_ADJUSTEMENT
)

TABLE ORDER_ITEMS (
   SERIAL ORDER_ITEMS_ID PRIMARY KEY,
   INTEGER ORDERS_ID FOREIGN_KEY ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID),
   INTEGER PRODUCT_ID,
   INTEGER QUANTITY,
   MONEY UNIT_PRICE
)
</pre>
<p>We have to create 2 <em>ghost</em> tables <code>MD_ORDERS</code> and
<code>MD_ORDER_ITEMS</code> :</p>
<pre>
TABLE MD_ORDERS (
   INT ORDERS_ID FOREIGN_KEY ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID),
   TIMESTAMP CTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   TIMESTAMP MTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   VARCHAR CLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
   VARCHAR MLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER()
)

TABLE ORDER_ITEMS (
   INT ORDER_ITEMS_ID FOREIGN_KEY ON ORDER_ITEMS(ORDER_ITEMS_ID),
   TIMESTAMP CTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   TIMESTAMP MTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   VARCHAR CLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
   VARCHAR MLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER()
)
</pre>
<p>The colums <code>CTIME</code> and <code>MTIME</code> are obviously like
their corresponding part in file-systems. <code>CLOGIN</code> and
<code>MLOGIN</code> are either the login used to connect to the database or for
a web application that usually have only one DB login the current application
user connected (To communicate this information to the database system, tt
could be inserted in a special temporary table at the beginning of each
request, scoped at the current connection/transaction/end-user-request/... in a
way shared by all applications).</p>
<p>Updating theses 2 tables is as easy as adding several TRIGGERS. (The
examples given below are only for ORDERS, for ORDER_ITEMS it's the same
pattern)</p>
<pre>
CREATE INSERT TRIGGER ON ORDERS o
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO MD_ORDERS (ORDERS_ID) VALUES (o.ORDERS_ID)
END

CREATE UPDATE TRIGGER ON ORDERS o
BEGIN
  UPDATE MD_ORDERS SET MTIME=NOW(), MLOGIN=CURRENT_USER()
    WHERE ORDERS_ID = o.ORDERS_ID
END
</pre>
<p>The obvious avantage to this that you can use this technique <strong>right
now</strong> on your application, since it doesn't require any applicative
change. The new columns are completely transparent. Even the locking scheme is
the same : if the shadow row has to be locked for updating, the underlaying
base row is currently also locked anyway. The only side effect is that you will
have effectively 2 times more updates in the database system, and therefore you
have to be careful at where you put your new tables (in order not to be bitten
by the I/O increase cost) if you have a clever table/tablespace layout.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that if you relax your foreign keys constraints you can
even log the <strong>deletion</strong> date of a row in the underlying base
table.</p>
<pre>
TABLE MD_ORDERS (
   INT ORDERS_ID ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID) INDEXED,
   TIMESTAMP CTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   TIMESTAMP MTIME DEFAULT NOW(),
   TIMESTAMP DTIME DEFAULT NULL,
   VARCHAR CLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
   VARCHAR MLOGIN DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
   VARCHAR DLOGIN DEFAULT NULL
)
</pre>
<p>The <code>DELETE</code> trigger is obvious, but the <code>INSERT</code> one
has to be careful to handle the insertion of a deleted entry.</p>
<p>This <em>delete</em> feature leads us to the next entry on <a href="/post/2009/03/Databases%3A-Version-History">Databases: Version History</a></p>
<p><strong>Edit(10/04/2009):</strong> Actually CTIME isn't the
<strong>C</strong>reation Time in POSIX as I first thought, but
<strong>C</strong>hange time. It's related to MTIME, as the MTIME takes also
the <em>content</em> into account. So we always have a later CTIME than MTIME
(or equal). And there seem to be <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part3/section-1.html" hreflang="en">no
Creation Time</a> in POSIX.</p>

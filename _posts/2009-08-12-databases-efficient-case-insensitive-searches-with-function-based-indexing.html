<h2>Special case of case-insensitive search</h2>
<p>In Oracle10g, you might use the new case-insensitive search with a
<code><a href="http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_oracle10g_release_2_case_insensitive_searches.htm" hreflang="en">NLS_SORT=BINARY_CI</a></code> command.</p>
<h3>Pro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed for this purpose, so it's very straightforward to use</li>
</ul>
<h3>Con</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limited to case-insensitive searching by design</li>
</ul>
<h2>Native functional indexes</h2>
<p>Some databases provides native functional indexes.</p>
<p>On these databases optimization is done simply by creating an index on
<code>UPPER(MY_COLUMN)</code> and letting the query optimizer
transparently<sup>[<a href="#pnote-426279-1" id="rev-pnote-426279-1" name="rev-pnote-426279-1">1</a>]</sup> use the newly created index.</p>
<p>It usually work by applies a function to the data just before handing it to
the index, so the function output doesn't exist in the database.</p>
<h3>Pro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Very</strong> easy to use : it just feels right (you can na√Øvely
create an index on the WHERE clause)</li>
<li>Doesn't take any extra space in the database (only the index).</li>
<li>Generic, can be used for something else than just case-insensitive
searches.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Con</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since the data isn't stored in the database, a call to the function has to
be made when</li>
<li>Functions have to be from the immutable category in the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/xfunc-volatility.html" hreflang="en">function volatility categories</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Generated columns</h2>
<p>DB2 provides something called <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v8/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.doc/ad/c0007004.htm" hreflang="en">generated columns</a>. It's almost the same than the native
indexes, except that the functional column is explicit.</p>
<h3>Pro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quite easy to use, since the column is updated and used transparently.</li>
<li>Generic, can be used for something else than just case-insensitive
searches. Just make sure the optimizer uses the extra column. You might have to
rewrite the request a little.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Con</h3>
<ul>
<li>Requires extra space in the table.</li>
<li>Removing a column can be cumbersome (in DB2 you have to recreate the whole
table for example), whereas removing a simple index is much easier.</li>
<li>The extra column is returned when doing a <code>SELECT * FROM
...</code><sup>[<a href="#pnote-426279-2" id="rev-pnote-426279-2" name="rev-pnote-426279-2">2</a>]</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trigger-based <em>Generated columns</em> Emulation</h2>
<p>If nothing else is provided, you always have the option to emulate. The
solution will be trigger-based since it's one of the few perfect match for
them.</p>
<p>So, the base idea is derived from the <em>Generated columns</em> : have a
special extra column that represents the output of the function. An index will
be created on this column and used via a <em>manual</em> update of the involved
requests (Adding an extra <code>WHERE</code> clause should be more than enough,
this way you might even benefit from a partial match).</p>
<h3>Pro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Universal. Useful if portability is paramount.</li>
<li>Very simple : there is no need to understand advanced database
features.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Con</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only a poor man's solution : everything is manual</li>
<li>The same than <em>Generated columns</em> since it's the same idea, just
manually implemented.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-426279-1" id="pnote-426279-1" name="pnote-426279-1">1</a>] You might have to update some kind of statistics for
the new index</p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-426279-2" id="pnote-426279-2" name="pnote-426279-2">2</a>] But you don't do that anyway, do you ?</p>

<p>Constraints are a very important tool in a programmer's belt. But they come
with a price, which can usually be mitigated simply.</p>
<h2><em>ACID</em>ity of transactions as rescue...</h2>
<p>Let's examine what all of the <code>A</code>, the <code>C</code>, the
<code>I</code> and the <code>D</code> have for implications on our current
subject.</p>
<h3>Transactions are <strong>atomic</strong> (A)</h3>
<p>The database should not really care about validating the constraints all the
time Only the beginning and end state is really important. <strong>Inside a
transaction, the data may be inconsistent</strong> : <q>Dust hasn't yet
settled</q>.</p>
<p>Let's study an example. You have an unique index on an ordering.</p>
<pre>
TABLE ITEMS (
    ITEM_ID SERIAL,
    GROUP_ID INTEGER,
    ORDER INTEGER,
    LABEL VARCHAR
)

ADD UNIQUE INDEX ON ITEMS(GROUP_ID, ORDER)
</pre>
<p>Here, if you want to swap 2 items, you have to use an unused temporary
value, otherwise the check won't be valid <strong>at all times</strong>.</p>
<h3>Transactions are <strong>consistent</strong> (C)</h3>
<p>The check <strong>needs</strong> to be done at least when the transaction
ends. No special need here except that you <strong>need</strong> to re-enable
before ending the transaction.</p>
<h3>Transactions are <strong>isolated</strong> (I)</h3>
<p>We can also easily imagine that the check only <strong>needs</strong> to be
done when the transaction ends, just before the commit. Normally no one should
be able to see the changing data meanwhile it's not completed.</p>
<p>One <strong>very important</strong> thing to know is that if you are using a
<strong>READ UNCOMMITTED isolation</strong> for other transactions <strong>you
will see inconsistent data</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are doing that, you know what you are doing and are obviously
taking special care about it, don't you ?</p>
<h3>Transactions are <strong>durable</strong> (D)</h3>
<p>This final property has nothing to do with our current issue. Good.</p>
<h2>... But sometimes early warning is quite nice</h2>
<p>When interacting with external systems, that don't participate in our
transaction, extra care should be taken in order to cope with the exceptional
case of a constraint failure. Distributed transactions is a very complex
subject, and usually it's not <del>supported</del> done<sup>[<a href="#pnote-415135-1" id="rev-pnote-415135-1" name="rev-pnote-415135-1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the principle of <em>least surprise</em> in mind, we can easily
understand why <code>deferred</code> is not the default behavior, but it makes
a very nice addition to our toolbox.</p>
<p>So now there isn't any good reason anymore not to use (and abuse)
constraints in your databases.</p>
<p>Remember, <strong>your data is you most precious asset</strong>, protect it
at all cost from evil misbehaved bug-ridden software<sup>[<a href="#pnote-415135-2" id="rev-pnote-415135-2" name="rev-pnote-415135-2">2</a>]</sup> !</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-415135-1" id="pnote-415135-1" name="pnote-415135-1">1</a>] Do you always implement a double-phase commit on every
SOAP/REST/XML-HTTP/POST interface that you expose ?</p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-415135-2" id="pnote-415135-2" name="pnote-415135-2">2</a>] Yeah, I have chosen my side in the coming war...</p>

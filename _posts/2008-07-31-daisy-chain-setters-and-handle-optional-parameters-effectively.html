<h4>The <em>Pure RAII</em> way</h4>
<p>You use many different constructor signatures. It's quite suboptimal if you
have many parameters that have nothing in common except their type : you have
to use the infamous <em><strong>null</strong></em>, or have a special value
that conveys a <em>not specified</em> meaning.</p>
<p>Code usage is something like this :</p>
<pre>
MyFile fileRead = new MyFile(&quot;in.txt&quot;, Flags.Read);
MyFile fileTemp = new MyFile(&quot;tmp.txt&quot;,
    Flags.Write, Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE);
MyFile fileWrite = new MyFile(&quot;out.txt&quot;,
    Flags.Write, null, Flags.Boolean.FALSE);
</pre>
<h4>The <em>JavaBean</em> way</h4>
<p>The JavaBean standard militates for a simple constructor : the default one.
The client uses then setters to initialize the object. This isn't RAII anymore,
but is a very common idiom in Java. But in my opinion the code produced (like
the one below) is quite cluttered.</p>
<p>It produces code like this :</p>
<pre>
MyFile file = new MyFile();
file.setFileName(fileName);
file.setOpenFlags(openFlags);
file.setShouldLock(shouldLock);
file.setIsSync(isSync);
file.setMaxFileSize(maxFileSize);
file.setReadAheadSize(readAheadSize);
</pre>
<h4>The <em>StringBuffer</em> way</h4>
<p>With the same trick as the <code>StringBuffer.append()</code>, it is
possible to chain all the setters just like this :</p>
<pre>
MyFile file = new MyFile()
    .setFileName(fileName)
    .setOpenFlags(openFlags)
    .setShouldLock(shouldLock)
    .setIsSync(isSync)
    .setMaxFileSize(maxFileSize)
    .setReadAheadSize(readAheadSize)
  ;
</pre>
<p>In my opinion this is more typo-proof, since you don't need to repeat the
variable name each time. It may also been seen as easier to read since the
whole initializing part is done in one block.</p>
<p>The main design point with this construct is that the setters must honor
<strong>exactly the same contract</strong> than the constructor does :</p>
<ul>
<li>They <strong>cannot</strong> return null (otherwise chaining them will
throw an uninformative <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html" hreflang="en">NPE</a>). Only exceptions are allowed to signal a failure while
setting the value.</li>
<li>In case they throw an exception, they have to cleanup any non-memory
resource, since the caller has no reference on the object anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are quite natural if you think of the setters as a extension to
the constructor. The object is still responsible for the resources it manages,
although the resources itself can change when calling setters (by setting a
different filename for example).</p>
<h4>The <em>Immutable</em> way</h4>
<p>Since every setter returns a MyFile, you can use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" hreflang="en">immutable</a>
design. It has many benefits, specifically <a href="http://blog.pwkf.org/post/2007/12/03/Use-immutable-objects-to-avoid-synchronisation" hreflang="en">when multi threading</a>. The concept is quite easy, and inspired
from the String object. Each constructor creates a brand new object that copies
every properties from the parent except the one that is changing. The downside
is it might create many unnecessary objects but it is a good concept for
factories that are seldom created, but used many times.</p>
<p>Factories, can then create object that have already all their properties set
with the factory default. It can then reuse pooled objets that have the same
properties.</p>
<p>An example for a factory can be :</p>
<pre>
private final static MyFileFactory fileFactory =
    new MyFileFactory().setIsSync(true);
...
    MyFile file =fileFactory.create(&quot;filename.txt&quot;);
</pre>
<p>The <code>MyFileFactory.create()</code> must honor the same contract than
the MyFile constructor for the same reasons than the setters do.</p>

<p>In the pure spirit of <a href="http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=211" hreflang="en">Data
is King</a> I think that URL should <strong>never</strong> change. Even the W3C
agrees with their <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html" hreflang="en">Cool URIs don't change</a> article.</p>
<p>But we all know that in IT <em>never</em> is only <em>not in the foreseen
future</em>. So URL <strong>do</strong> change, at least after a while, and
usually for technical reasons<sup>[<a href="#pnote-397657-1" id="rev-pnote-397657-1" name="rev-pnote-397657-1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Since you can update your website to update the URLs, but the inbound link
cannot be easily updated. To handle this need, the HTTP protocol has specified
the 301 response code.</p>
<p>The solution is that the site should remember all the urls that it generated
and redirects accordingly. This way you'll never loose a potential reader to
the infamous 404 (this page does not exist).</p>
<p>Some sites even try to approximate the page on a custom 404 page. That's
another reason to have user-friendly urls : to be able to hint your reader to
appropriate pages in case you don't find his initial destination.</p>
<p>Sadly, this redirect behavior isn't supported by my blog engine
(dotclear)... That's for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_one%27s_own_dog_food" hreflang="en">eat
your own dog's food</a>, but I'm looking forward to do it on my current
blogging platform.</p>

<p>I discovered some time ago the marvelous <code>dev_scripts/</code> directory
in the munin source code. So, as its usage is <em>very</em> easy, I'll just
write a tutorial about how to use it</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To use it, one has to install all the packages needed for munin, and to grab
a copy of the source code. Easiest is to use either a tarball, or to clone the
git repository.</p>
<p>Note that the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/browser/munin/README?rev=master" hreflang="en">guidelines on contributing</a> back are specified directly in the git
repo.</p>
<p>Now, I just assume you want to contribute back, otherwise you would not care
much about the said dev environment. That means using the git way of doing
it.</p>
<h2>Download the source code</h2>
<p>First step is to clone the git repository. We will use
<code>$HOME/src/munin</code> as the development directory.</p>
<pre>
mkdir -p $HOME/src
cd $HOME/src
git clone https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin munin
cd munin
</pre>
<h2>Compile munin</h2>
<p>Now, we have to compile the source code. I know that it sounds strange as
the code is mostly Perl, but there are some templates that need to be filled
with the environment specifics, such as the Perl interpreter path, a POSIX
compatible shell, ...</p>
<pre>
dev_scripts/install 1
</pre>
<p>Now all munin (and munin-node) should be compiled and installed in
<code>$HOME/src/munin/sandbox</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>1</code> at the end is explained below.</p>
<h2>Using the dev tools</h2>
<p>There are some different tools in <code>dev_scripts/</code> :</p>
<h3>install</h3>
<p>This is the one you used already. You have to use it every time you want to
recompile &amp; deploy the package.</p>
<p>The <code>1</code> argument, does a full re-install (wipe &amp; install), so
you don't usually want to do that.</p>
<h3>restart_munin-node</h3>
<p>This is a tool to start the development node. Note that it listens on the
port 4948, so you can use it alongside a normal munin-node.</p>
<h3>run</h3>
<p>The <code>run</code> command inside is used to launch all the executable
parts of munin, such as <code>munin-update</code>, <code>munin-html</code> or
<code>munin-limits</code>. It can also be used to launch <code>munin-run</code>
and <code>munin-node-configure</code>.</p>
<p>The usage is very simple, just prefix the command to launch with
<code>dev_scripts/run</code>, every environment variable and command line
argument will be forwarded to the said command.</p>
<pre>
# launch munin-cron
dev_scripts/munin-cron

# launch manually some cron parts
dev_scripts/munin-update
dev_scripts/munin-limits
dev_scripts/munin-html
dev_scripts/munin-graph

# debug a plugin
dev_scripts/munin-run --debug cpu config
</pre>
<h3>cgi</h3>
<p>This is the same as <code>run</code>, only for CGI. It sets up the whole
environment vars that emulates a CGI call. Usage is very easy :</p>
<pre>
dev_scripts/cgi munin-cgi-graph /localnet/localhost/cpu-day.png &gt; out.dat
</pre>
<p>The <code>out.dat</code> will contain the whole HTTP output, with the HTTP
headers and the PNG content. Everything that is sent to STDERR won't be
catched, so you can liberally use it while debugging.</p>
<h3>query_munin_node</h3>
<p>The <code>query_munin_node</code> is used to send commands to the node in a
very simple way. Node commands are just args of the tool.</p>
<pre>
dev_scripts/query_munin_node list
dev_scripts/query_munin_node config cpu
dev_scripts/query_munin_node fetch cpu
</pre>
<h2>Real CGI usage with your web browser</h2>
<p>That's the holy grail. You will have a development version that behaves the
same as a real munin install.</p>
<p>First, let's assume you have a working user cgi configuration (ie
<code>~user/cgi/whatever</code> is working). If not you should refer yourself
to the local documentation of your preferred webserver. Note that nginx will
_not_ work, as <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/ThttpdCGI" hreflang="en">it does
not support CGI</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a very simple cgi wrapper script. The home dir is hard coded in the
script.</p>
<pre>
#! /bin/sh

ROOT=/home/me/src/munin
eval &quot;$(perl -V:version)&quot;

PERL5LIB=$ROOT/sandbox/usr/local/share/perl/$version
#export DBI_TRACE=2=/tmp/dbitrace.log

exec perl -T -I $PERL5LIB $ROOT/sandbox/opt/munin/www/cgi/$CGI_NAME
</pre>

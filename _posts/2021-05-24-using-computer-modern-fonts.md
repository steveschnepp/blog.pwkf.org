title: "Using Computer Modern Fonts"
tags: [blog]
---

I always tried to have a minimalist blog style. I almost totally agree with
[Fabien Sanglard's 0x10 rules](https://fabiensanglard.net/ilike/index.html),
except on the part with "monotype fonts".

As a matter of fact, I even started to use proportional fonts as my coding
font. Which is not a common trait to say the least. But it seems [I'm not
alone](https://storck.io/posts/proportional-programming-code-fonts/), in
thinking it. And I totally agree with Martijn's statement that the terminal is
**the** realm of monospaced fonts.

That said, I also love the esthetics of TeX, most notably due to its usage of
Computer Modern fonts. Therefore I naturally wanted to use those on my blog,
and therefore I searched how to do that.

Note that I agree that most of TeX appeal is due to its layout engine, more
than its fonts. And that is something that isn't easily reproduced in a web
browser. So for purists, there's some uncanny valley, as [it was mentioned on
HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24625678). But for me, it looks good
enough. And it does fulfill the primary goal I was after in choosing such 
a font: *originality*. To have a distinct look, even if a little weird makes
it stand out of the crowd.

<h2>Type unique : One sequence per table</h2>
<p>The most common idiom out there. Just define a surrogate key per table,
usually done via an <code>auto_increment</code> field, <code>serial</code>
field or a <code>sequence</code> per table.</p>
<p>It is the most natural way of thinking, since the ID is usually seen as a
monotically incrementing counter. Therefore many applications use even the
evil<sup>[<a href="#pnote-401164-1" id="rev-pnote-401164-1" name="rev-pnote-401164-1">1</a>]</sup> <code>SELECT MAX(ID)+1</code> construct,
because they specifically require that there should be no missed rows and that
the ID have to be strictly in order.</p>
<p>The usual implementation of this is to have a kind of thread-local function
that hands unique ID allocated in group and never trying to reuse an already
issued/allocated ID. If you reserve 50 ID at once you directly level the cost
of locking the ressource to only 1 in 50 requests, and not trying to reuse them
enables you to just have to lock the end of the spectrum and not the whole
spectrum. That's what the <code>CACHE</code> keyword is about in <a href="http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/sequences.php" hreflang="en">Oracle</a> and
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/sql-createsequence.html" hreflang="en">PostgreSQL</a>. Others RDBMS usually also have a similar
option</p>
<p>But this optimisation leaves us with a big side-effect : the ID that are
generated are not strictly in order anymore, and furthermore there can be huge
gaps in them. Since one of the main purpose of one ID per table is now gone,
why not directly bite the bullet and use the same ID generation on the the
whole application ?</p>
<h2>Application unique : One sequence to rule them all</h2>
<p>This is something I first experienced with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" hreflang="en">Subversion</a>, coming from a CVS
background : the revision number is repository-wide and not file-wide anymore.
This has some mental drawbacks at first, since you still know that a file of
version 5324 is more recent than version 3200, but not <em>how much</em> more
since the commits could have been done in another place. The difference is more
visible with 1.4 versus 1.5.</p>
<p>But as I was more used to it, that thinking was obviously a red herring. It
did divert us that a file could have been completely rewritten in just one
revision, and that one signle line could have be flipped back and forth in
several revisions,</p>
<p>So the number, and the gap between them, as the basis of the amount of
modifications has its value decreased. What could be quite interesting though
is that the revision number is globally incrementing<sup>[<a href="#pnote-401164-2" id="rev-pnote-401164-2" name="rev-pnote-401164-2">2</a>]</sup>. That enables us to know that a file in
revision 1000 was commited before another one with revision 2000.</p>
<p>Back in our database, if we just define <strong>one</strong> sequence for
all the ID in the database we have 2 advantages :</p>
<ol>
<li>One ID represents only one row. Debugging is easier and when you see an ID
<em>in the wild</em>, you can think of which row it represents.</li>
<li>You can establish an almost exact history of sequencing the creations of
the rows.</li>
</ol>
<p>The inevitable locking performance issue that arises often is made painless
through bigger block allocations.</p>
<p>One of the lesser known issue is that, usually when using an ID per table,
after a while you begin to <em>know</em> which ID belongs to wich table since
all the tables are filled at different rates : 50083 is an order ID, whereas
13650239 looks more like a message ID.</p>
<h2>Globally unique :</h2>
<p>If you push this logic a little bit further, you can even imagine that all
the ID produced could be unique. Then you will have the benefits of unicity,
but even on the whole IT level. It makes interapplication debugging easier,
since the leaked keys can be nicely tracked down to their origin. How to
generate such an unique ID is tricky question, since the applications usually
are coded in heterogeneous environemments and technologies.</p>
<h3>A central ID service</h3>
<p>The most obvious way is to have a central ID service, the same as the unique
sequence in the application. It has to be accessed in a distributed way, and
the implementation can be quite cumbersome thoughout all the different
technologies that exists.</p>
<p>This service has also to have the highest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_level_agreement" hreflang="en">SLA</a> as
the applications that depends on it. It becomes then quickly a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure" hreflang="en">SPOF</a>
if not designed carefully.</p>
<h3>GUID</h3>
<p>Since <em>online</em> ID generation has some serious drawbacks, the easiest
<em>offline</em> way is to generate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Unique_Identifier" hreflang="en">GUID</a>s, there are many hooks in each technology/application to be a
quite educated move.</p>
<p>It also has drawbacks, but more in the semantic fields. A GUID is quite
semantically opaque since looking at it does not tell you anything about
where/when the ID was generated. You have to do a full key scan of all the
applications to find its origin.</p>
<h3>Almost globally unique : Application ID + Application Unique</h3>
<p>Earlier, we just found out the application-unique ID. If you pair it with an
unique application ID, you just managed to have a globally unique ID. In the
generation of this ID, you just prefix it with the ID of the application, and
tada.... you have your globally unique ID.</p>
<p>The net effect is that if you see this ID in the wild, you know where it was
created. If you have an increasing one, you can even guess almost
<em>when</em>.</p>
<h2>Parallels between applications and networks</h2>
<p>The more I think about it, the more I can draw parallels between rows in
applications and adresses in networks, but I'll write more on that later in
another article.</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-401164-1" id="pnote-401164-1" name="pnote-401164-1">1</a>] Evil because it's usually not thread safe and quite
horridly inefficient</p>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-401164-2" id="pnote-401164-2" name="pnote-401164-2">2</a>] Actually in subversion it has a **strict** incrementing
policy</p>

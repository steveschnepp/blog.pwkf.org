title: Sizes of SMD Components Explained

Through-hole tech is very nice for hobbyists. But it is getting obsolete. And many components are not available anymore in anything else than SMD. The main problem is that there isn't a single standard size anymore

# Passive Devices - Resistors and Capacitors

Those are very simple. They are rectangular, and the
package naming is a number that directly reflects its
size. For example, 1812, 1206 and 0805 refer to
measurements in hundreds of inches. There is also a metric equivalent, but the imperial numberings seems prevalent.

# Semiconductors

Active components on the other hand, are a mess. But
Vishay has a nice document on [SMD package
sizes](https://www.vishay.com/docs/80128/package-drawing-collection.pdf).

[STUDIOPIETERSÂ®](https://www.studiopieters.nl/smd-sizes-and-packages/) has even
a [nice SMD sizing
cheat sheet](https://github.com/AchimPieters/SMD-Reference-Sheets/raw/master/SMD%20REFERENCE%20SHEET%20V3.pdf)
that can be printed in 1:1 scale.

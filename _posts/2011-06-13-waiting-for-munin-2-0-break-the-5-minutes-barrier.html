<p>Every monitoring software has a polling rate. It is usually 5 min, because
it's the sweet spot that enables frequent updates yet still having a low
overhead.</p>
<p>Munin is not different in that respect : it's data fetching routines
<strong>have</strong> to be launched every 5 min, otherwise you'll face data
loss. And this 5 min period is deeply grained in the code. So changing it is
possible, but very tedious and error prone.</p>
<p>But sometimes we need a very fine sampling rate. Every 10 seconds enables us
to track fast changing metrics that would be averaged out otherwise. Changing
the whole polling process to cope with a 10s period is very hard on hardware,
since now <strong>every</strong> update has to finish in these 10 seconds.</p>
<p>This triggered an extension in the plugin protocol, commonly known as
<em>supersampling</em>.</p>
<h2>Supersampling</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The basic idea is that fine precision should only be for selected plugins
only. It also cannot be triggered from the master, since the overhead would be
way too big.</p>
<p>So, we just let the plugin sample itself the values at a rate it feels
adequate. Then each polling round, the master fetches all the samples since
last poll.</p>
<p>This enables various constructions, mostly around <em>streaming</em> plugins
to achieve highly detailed sampling with a very small overhead.</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>This protocol is currently completely transparent to
<code>munin-node</code>, and therefore it means that it can be used even on
older (1.x) nodes. Only a 2.0 master is required.</p>
<h3>Protocol details</h3>
<p>The protocol itself is derived from the spoolfetch extension.</p>
<h4>Config</h4>
<p>A new directive is used, <code>update_rate</code>. It enables the master to
create the rrd with an adequate step.</p>
<p>Omitting it would lead to rrd averaging the supersampled values onto the
default 5 min rate. This means <strong>data loss</strong>.</p>
<h5>Notes</h5>
<p>The heartbeat has always a 2 step size, so failure to send all the samples
will result with unknown values, as expected.</p>
<p>The RRD file size is always the same in the default config, as all the RRA
are configured proportionally to the <code>update_rate</code>. This means that,
since you'll keep as much data as with the default, you keep it for a shorter
time.</p>
<h4>Fetch</h4>
<p>When spoolfetching, the epoch is also sent in front of the value.
Supersampling is then just a matter of sending multiple epoch/value lines, with
monotonically increasing epoch. Note that since the epoch is an integer value
for rrdtool, the smallest granularity is 1 second. For the time being, the
protocol itself does also mandates integers. We can easily imagine that with
another database as backend, an extension could be hacked together.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with 1.4</h3>
<p>On older 1.4 masters, only the last sampled value gets into the rrd.</p>
<h3>Sample implementation</h3>
<p>The canonical sample implementation is multicpu1sec, a contrib plugin on
github. It is also a so-called streaming plugin.</p>
<h3>Streaming plugins</h3>
<p>These plugins fork a background process when called that streams a system
tool into a spool file. In multipcu1sec, it is the <code>mpstat</code> tool
with a period of 1 second.</p>
<h2>Undersampling</h2>
<p>Some plugins are on the opposite side of the spectrum, as they only need a
lower precision.</p>
<p>It makes sense when :</p>
<ul>
<li>data should be kept for a <em>very</em> long time</li>
<li>data is <strong>very</strong> expensive to generate and it doesn't vary
fast.</li>
</ul>

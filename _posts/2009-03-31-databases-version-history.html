<p>One concept gaining huge momentum lately is file versionning (mostly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" hreflang="en">Git</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)" hreflang="en">Subversion</a>). It is quite interesting to track the evolution of the
data contained in the files, and not only the last time the file was
updated.</p>
<p>On the last post <a href="/post/2009/03/Databases%3A-Meta-Data-ctime-mtime">Databases: Meta-Data</a> I
was discussing about the merits of having a modification timestamp among with
other various informations and more generally about the parallels between a
database and a filesystem.</p>
<p>We can also adapt this model to our database by not only storing the last
modification date, but also the old data.</p>
<p>Two main options are :</p>
<ul>
<li>replicate the whole row in a <em>history table</em></li>
<li>have a generic <em>history table</em> that only store the old values of the
column that have changed</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach is done in the way <a href="http://www.ddj.com/database/184406340">this ddj database article</a>, but in a
much less intrusive manner. We just have our trigger-based system evolve with
every modification logging an insertion in the derived history table.</p>
<p>The history table and trigger become :</p>
<pre>
TABLE MD_ORDERS_HISTORY (
   SERIAL MD_ORDERS_HISTORY_ID PRIMARY KEY,
   TIMESTAMP CTIME,
   CHAR TYPE DEFAULT 'M',
   INT ORDERS_ID FOREIGN_KEY ON ORDERS(ORDERS_ID),
   MONEY PRICE_ADJUSTMENT
)

CREATE INSERT TRIGGER ON ORDERS o
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO MD_ORDERS (ORDERS_ID) VALUES (o.ORDERS_ID)
END

CREATE UPDATE TRIGGER ON ORDERS o
BEGIN
  UPDATE MD_ORDERS SET MTIME=NOW(), MLOGIN=CURRENT_USER()
    WHERE ORDERS_ID = o.ORDERS_ID
  -- Log the change
  INSERT INTO MD_ORDERS_HISTORY (ORDERS_ID, PRICE_ADJUSTMENT)
    VALUES (o.ORDERS_ID, o.PRICE_ADJUSTMENT)
END

CREATE DELETE TRIGGER ON ORDERS o
BEGIN
  -- Log the delete
  INSERT INTO MD_ORDERS_HISTORY (ORDERS_ID, PRICE_ADJUSTMENT, TYPE)
    VALUES (o.ORDERS_ID, o.PRICE_ADJUSTMENT, 'D')
END
</pre>
<p>The interesting point is that you can now travel back in time in order to
see what happened to a row in case of debugging the application or its
(mis)usage.</p>
<p>The main issue of this system is that your database usage will be larger by
several orders of magnitude, depending of how often your application update its
data.</p>
<p>Several possibilities to limit the size exists :</p>
<ul>
<li>Partitioning the historical data, and storing it on a slower (cheaper)
array.</li>
<li>Pruning the old data since depending on the application, traveling back 1
whole year may be overkill</li>
<li>Live aggregating changes. If the data was modified less than 1 hour ago,
just update the last history line. We can even have a
<code>history_start</code> timestamp and <code>history_stop</code> timestamp to
show that a aggregation has taken place.</li>
<li>Deferred aggregating changes. Like the live one, but on a scheduled basis.
It can even have a dynamic granularity (a granularity of 1 day if the data is 1
year old, 1 hour if it is 1 month old).</li>
</ul>

<p>DotClear automatically generates a <code>meta description</code> tag from
the blog entry, but it doesn't take the excerpt into account.</p>
<p>It just takes the beginning of the article <strong>content</strong>. Since
the excerpt is also shown at the beginning of the article, I cannot just write
2 times the same content.</p>
<p><code>meta description</code> is quite interesting since it is usually used
for the little snipped under a search result in usual search engines, so having
the beginning of the post in here is very nice.</p>
<p>This fact annihilates the <a href="/post/2009/05/Are-Excerpts-a-Good-Thing">good point of having
excerpts</a>.</p>
<p>I'm now falling back to removing progressively all the excerpts on my
posts...</p>

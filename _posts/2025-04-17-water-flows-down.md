I'm always frustrated by heavy processes. They usually feel like unneeded
overhead to get the job done. Let's explore that overhead world, as some is
actually desirable.

# Nudge theory

The [Nudge theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory) is a simple
concept that leverages the unconscious bias in each individual.

> A nudge makes it more likely that an individual will make a particular
> choice, or behave in a particular way, by altering the environment so that
> automatic cognitive processes are triggered to favour the desired outcome.

Each individual will usually favor the least painful way to do something.

Therefore, if a pattern needs to be avoided unless really necessary, it makes
sense to make it painful.

# Water flows down

This is reflected in the saying:

> Design for water to go down and it will work right away.
>
> Design for water to go up and it will still work, but require a lot of effort
> all the time, as you need someone to pump.

And, no, automating the pumping act is **not a good idea**. Automation here is
*totally* missing the point.

One should redesign the thing to fully avoid the pain, not automate it away. As
automation is even more additional maintenance effort that piles up over time.

# Overhead as a Nudge

So, the obvious conclusion to it is that:

A nicely designed process adds overhead **on purpose** to nudge its users to
avoid it, and do the better thing instead.

So, each time you want to automate some overhead away, think about it : Is your
water flowing down or up?

<p>A common issue is that a blog entry takes time to be written, refined and
then published. Therefore the date contained in the URL isn't the publication
time. But since the publication time is the time the entry is created in the
point of view of the public the date in the URL conveys only little meaning,
just the time is took to create it.</p>
<p>Another point is that some blogger, i'm no exception, just create an entry
to make a note. Theses entries are composed of bare notes without any relation
or phrases. It serves as a unique receptacle of related raw ideas, useful not
to loose them or to be obliged to scan through many medium just to make sure we
didn't forget something that we thought important earlier. Then the date in the
URL conveys very little meaning, mostly when we first had the idea about
it.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, a date in the URL is quite interesting to know the
relative age of a post without having to look in detail inside. This
information is especially important in a technical field such as IT where the
world is turning around quite fast.</p>
<p>We can see now that the <strong>timing</strong> information is important,
just that the standard precision of <strong>one day</strong> is a bit overkill.
All depends on the time taken to write the blog entry, and on the time scope it
we be relevant.</p>
<p>For a article about a precise event, a precision of one day is interesting.
At this end of the scale, blog entries that relates a event throughout a day
would even have a hour precision. If most of the articles had a shift of 1 to 2
days in the creation time and the publication time, a precision of a day would
be a fair deal. And the other side of the spectrum, an article about a slowing
evolving subject such as demographic studies are fairly represented by a yearly
url. For timeless subject such as philosophy, I still think that yearly would
be adequate since one year represent quite a long time on a human scale.</p>
<p>Since usually my blog entries are in gestation for about 1 to 3 weeks, and
are about IT subjects, a monthly precision is the most interesting since that
conveys an adequate timing information in a changing world without having a
false impression of exactitude.</p>
<p>Therefore I'm changing my URL format to a monthly rule, meanwhile allowing
myself a different precision for special entries on specific subjects.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly it is very discouraged to change the URL once it's published
since otherwise you have to redirect all the links<sup>[<a href="#pnote-391283-1" id="rev-pnote-391283-1" name="rev-pnote-391283-1">1</a>]</sup> that are currently pointing on it.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-391283-1" id="pnote-391283-1" name="pnote-391283-1">1</a>] from your other articles, from other blogs or from
search engines</p>

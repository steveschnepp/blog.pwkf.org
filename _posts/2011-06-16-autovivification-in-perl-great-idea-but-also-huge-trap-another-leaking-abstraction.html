<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autovivification" hreflang="en">Autovivification</a> is one of Perl's really great design success.</p>
<p>It all comes to <em>you don't need to worry about existence before
dereferencing something</em>.</p>
<p>That means, for setting a nested hash, you only need to write :</p>
<pre>
$h-&gt;{foo}{bar} = &quot;value&quot;;
</pre>
<p>And that will work out of the box. Perl will happily create all the
data-structure for you.</p>
<p>So, now a little coding test, what does the following code output ?</p>
<pre>
my $a;

if ($a-&gt;{foo}{bar}) {
   print &quot;Found foo/bar
&quot;;
}

if ($a-&gt;{foo}) {
   print &quot;Found foo
&quot;;
}
</pre>
<p>Naively, it shouldn’t output anything, right ?</p>
<p>Not so fast. Upon a careful read of <q>Perl will happily create all the
data-structure for you</q>, we can put some emphasis on one word : <q>Perl will
happily <strong>create</strong> all the data-structure for you</q>.</p>
<p>That might be just perfect, except that Perl creates it whenever it needs
it, even if it is only for <strong>reading</strong>.</p>
<p>And now you understand the catch : a <strong>read</strong> operation can
result in a <strong>write</strong> one.</p>
<p>As Uncle Ben (from SpiderMan) said<sup>[<a href="#pnote-614219-1" id="rev-pnote-614219-1" name="rev-pnote-614219-1">1</a>]</sup> : <q>With Great
Power Comes Great Responsibility</q>.</p>
<p><a href="http://search.cpan.org/~ilmari/" hreflang="en">Dagfinn Ilmari
Mannsåker</a> showed me a nice <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?autovivification" hreflang="en">autovivification</a> module on CPAN that fixes this behavior, and enables
a fine tuning of this process.</p>
<p>I really think the fact that creation also happen when querying the value is
a real bug in Perl itself, or at least a bug in the design of the feature.</p>

<p>[<a href="#rev-pnote-614219-1" id="pnote-614219-1" name="pnote-614219-1">1</a>] Voltaire, Franklin D. Roosevelt and other said
something very similar, but they are not as geeky.</p>

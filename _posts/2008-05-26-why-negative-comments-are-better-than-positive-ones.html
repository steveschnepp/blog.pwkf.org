<p>Why Negative comments are better than positive ones If you are reading this
blog and thinking <q>Hey ! What a He's just talking nonsense...</q> please
don't walk away in horror. It would be very much appreciated if you drop me a
comment about what is wrong in my post instead. I actually
<strong>prefer</strong> to have negative comments than positive ones... at
least when they are well argumented.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, we mostly learn by our mistakes. If you do something
and it works, you are really happy but you don't know <strong>why</strong> it
works. The next time you have to do something quite similar you are tempted to
change the least possible in order not to be disappointed. This leads to the
infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming">Cargo
Cult Programming</a> effect. Whereas if it doesn't work you spend some times,
but just learned something that you can subsequently reuse.</p>
<p>It's actually by been challenged that you make the most interesting
progress. I nevertheless agree that when in isolation your raw productivity is
much bigger than when being part of a team. The reason if quite obvious : since
you don't have to argue with others, you can spend all your time doing
<em>useful</em> stuff. The main problem with this approach is that the
<em>real</em> goal (where you really should go), isn't necessarily where you
<em>think</em> it is. So you just might go very fast, but aiming the wrong
goal. Sometimes the very fact explaining something to someone (that didn't even
disagree) can show you the internal problems of your way of thinking.</p>
<p>It's actually the <em>convincing-battle</em> that you have to fight with
your audience/co-workers/etc that leads to the most interesting solutions. We
are all humans, and each had different experiences, hence different point of
views. So the real cleverness is to be able to take the ladder of your
opinions, climb with them on the shoulder of giants and give the feed back your
fellow giants what your new point of view gives you to see. I really insist on
the feed-back stage, knowledge is something you can even increase by giving it,
since it usually makes you think ways that you would not have explored
normally.</p>
<p>So I do write in this blog with my own convictions. It is certainly not the
<strong>universal truth</strong>, but it's my very own vision of it. If you
feel that I'm wrong, feel free to tell me : I don't say I'll agree with you,
but it may be a very interesting <em>battle</em> that might even elevate both
of us.</p>

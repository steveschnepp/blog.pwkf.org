Originally a blog about [PWKF, an easy-to-use
workflow](post/2008/01/05/A-Little-History-of-PWKF) solution, but as my
interest in PWKF faded, it evolved into a generic blog.

Therefore now it is more about random thoughts,
[Munin](https://munin-monitoring.org/) or even low-level techy stuff I'm doing
with my sons.

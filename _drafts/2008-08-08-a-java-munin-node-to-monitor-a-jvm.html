<p>Why a whole Node ?</p>
<ul>
<li>a JVM is like a host</li>
<li>can register some custom elements</li>
<li>has some predef elements</li>
<li>very easy (munin power is the architecture, and the protocol)</li>
<li>multiple hosts -- multiple web sites</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe osoblete since there are JMX plugins for Munin now.</p>

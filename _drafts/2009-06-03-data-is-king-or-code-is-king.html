<p>An often overlooked secret of <strong>computing</strong> is that it
<strong>is</strong> all and mostly about 2 things : <strong>data</strong> and
<strong>algorithms</strong>.</p>
<p>The resulting 2 kinds of programmers differ in their relationship with the
code they produce, especially in how it handles data.</p>
<h2>Code is King</h2>
<p>Several key points :</p>
<ul>
<li>The most important asset is the code. Special care is taken to put layer
upon layer in order to be able for the code to survive any change outside
itself.</li>
<li>Databases are mostly taken as a glorified data dump.</li>
<li>Data constraints (unicity &amp; nullness) are enforced at the application
level.</li>
<li>Coding speed is paramount.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PHP/MySQL tandem is a typical example of this philosophy, I think this
has precisely led to the common understanding that MySQL is a database that is
very fast but not so careful or feature-full as others.</p>
<p>The various J2EE stacks is also a good example with the ubiquitous ORM
solutions, such a Hibernate that tries very hard to reproduce the joining and
data checks in the Java.</p>
<p>The current NoSQL meme turns also around this. Data is quite cheap, and can
be</p>
<h2>Data is King</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developper-centric / DBA centric</li>
<li>fast ROI, long investment</li>
<li>&quot;Data is King&quot; makes you vendor independent, since code can always be
rewritten. Data on the other hand, isn't that easily converted.</li>
</ul>
<h2>AJAX is a modern version of the same divide</h2>
<p>More and more we put more and more code inside the browser with the help of
JavaScript. In the end, the application server tend to be not much more than a
way to relay Ajax/JSON requests to the database, the extreme rationalization of
this is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB" hreflang="en">CouchDB</a>.</p>

As Wikipedia stated it, [Schmitt
trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger) are typically used in
to remove noise from signals used in digital circuits.

This makes it one of the most important digital circuit, as induced noise in
the biggest issue for increasting frequency, therefore performance.

Passive noise isolation is the first defense, but it usually is not enough.

## Classic with OpAmp

*Typical IC : LM358*

Many different circuits do exists, but the first one that is encountered
is the one that comes with OpAmp.

The basic working principle is that:

* The OpAmp is configured in comparator mode. This means that there is no
  feeback loop, and the OpAmp has its full gain[^1].
* The comparison is done with a different reference depending on the next edge
  being a rising one or a falling one.

[^1]: Usually around 1e5, which means that a full 5V swing will occur when
there's as little as 0.5mV (5e-5) difference between the inputs.

In detail, the inverting input is compared to a tension divisor that is
mid-voltage.

But as we have a 300kÎ© resistor that biases that divisor with some of the
output, the comparison is not done anymore with always the same reference
value : it depends if the output is low or high.

This in turn triggers the Schmitt effect, as the flip is happening at
different voltage on the rising edge than on the falling edge.

# Using an Open Collector Comparator

*Typical IC : LM393*

It is very similar than the OpAmp.

Usually a comparator has a open collector output, therefore it needs an
additional pull-up resistor.

The side-effect of relying on a pull-up is that the output voltage is depending
on the load. Therefore the hysteresis effect of the schmitt trigger also
depends on the load. The trigger might need a buffered output to ensure that
the load is minimal.

## Using a NOT gate

*Typical IC : 4069*[^2]

Using a NOT gate is very similar to the OpAmp. 

[^2]: Of course, the TTL (7404) and HC (74HC04) versions do work the same way. And so would a NAND or NOR that have entries tried together.

Only the reference is fixed, and half Vcc. We therefore need to bias the input
according to the output.

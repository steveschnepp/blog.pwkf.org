## Intro

As Wikipedia stated it, [Schmitt
trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schmitt_trigger) are typically used in
to remove noise from signals used in digital circuits.

This means that it is one of the most used analog circuits in digital ones, as
induced noise in the biggest issue for increasting frequency, therefore
performance.

A good passive noise isolation is mitigating most of it, but it isn't enough.

Many different circuits do exists.

<li>setup SVK as usual with FSFS (BDB might work, but why bother ?)</li>
<li>move $HOME/.svk/local (the svn repo) to your USB stick</li>
<li>use of depotmap, describes by the author and by a tutorial</li>
<li>edit $HOME/.svk/config to point &quot;depotmap&quot; to the moved local svn
repos</li>
<li>Repeat the same process (but not copying the repo to the stick) on each of
you computer.</li>
<li>Enjoy distributed work.</li>

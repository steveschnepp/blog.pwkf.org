This is my Blog, which has some [history](_posts/2008-01-05-a-little-history-of-pwkf.html).

I customized a [Minima Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) by adding
* __Changed fonts__, to give it a [Computer Modern look](_posts/2021-05-24-using-computer-modern-fonts.md)
* __Colored info panels__ in [main.scss](https://github.com/steveschnepp/blog.pwkf.org/blob/master/assets/main.scss#L81-L143)
* __Tag Cloud Navigation__ in [tags-cloud.md](https://github.com/steveschnepp/blog.pwkf.org/blob/master/_includes/tags-cloud.md?plain=1)
* __Next/Previous Navigation__, along with tag-based __Related Navigation__ in [prev_next.html](https://github.com/steveschnepp/blog.pwkf.org/blob/master/_includes/prev-next.html)
* __Read Time Estimation__ in [read-time.html](https://github.com/steveschnepp/blog.pwkf.org/blob/master/_includes/read-time.html)

Those coding elements where _inspired_ from various other blog posts, mostly about Jekyll.
